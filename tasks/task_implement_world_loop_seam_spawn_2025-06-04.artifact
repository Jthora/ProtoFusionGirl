# TODO: Seamless World Loop & Spawn at Seam (2025-06-04)

## Requirements
- The world is a horizontal loop: the leftmost tile (0) is adjacent to the rightmost tile (circumference - 1).
- The main character and camera must spawn exactly at the seam (tile 0,0 or (circumference,0)), visually centered.
- Movement, rendering, and world logic must seamlessly wrap around this edgeâ€”no visible gap, glitch, or coordinate overflow.
- The player and camera can move left from the first tile and appear on the last tile, and vice versa.
- All systems (collision, chunk loading, minimap, etc.) must treat the world as a torus horizontally.
- The world appears flat to the player, but the code/data must treat it as a loop.

## Next Steps
- Update tilemap/camera/player spawn logic to support seamless looping.
- Add tests to ensure no visual or logic discontinuity at the seam.
- Document this requirement in the tilemap system design artifact.
