description: |
  - Implement the sync command in aiTaskManager.js to auto-create/update task.artifact files from code TODOs, link tasks to code/artifacts, and mark tasks as done if code reference is removed
  - Add a --json flag to all major scripts (list, index, dashboard, task scripts) for JSON output
  - Add .vscode/tasks.json to expose key scripts as VSCode tasks for one-click access
  - Add a Git pre-commit hook or npm script to auto-run artifact/task indexing and cleanup scripts before every commit
  - Add a script (e.g., notifyOpenTasks.js) to output summaries of open/high-priority/blocked/overdue tasks
  - Add a script (e.g., autoRepairArtifacts.js) to detect/fix missing headers, broken links, outdated fields, or inconsistent tags in artifacts/tasks
  - Upgrade project_dashboard.js to accept commands (e.g., --next-action, --json) and output actionable next steps for Copilot
  - Enhance onboarding script to detect missing context, outdated artifacts, or onboarding gaps and auto-create tasks to address them
  - Provide scripts to generate new artifact/task templates with all required fields (e.g., newArtifact.js)
  - Add a help command to aiTaskManager.js and other scripts to output usage/options/examples in text and JSON
  - Add a script that helps enable Copilot to automatically and autonomously self-prompt in a cycle
  - Apply upgrades that can be universally applied to all 11 upgrades previously mentioned on this list
