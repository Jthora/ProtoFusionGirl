description: |
  - Refactor AI/pathfinding to use toroidal math for all X logic
  - Implement toroidal minimap/world map UI
  - Refactor projectile and physics systems for toroidal logic
  - Audit and update persistence/save-load for wrapped coordinates
  - Implement edge-aware rendering for sprites/effects at the seam
  - Decide and implement vertical world boundaries or wrapping
  - Add/expand automated tests for toroidal math and seam edge cases
  - Expand documentation and onboarding artifacts with toroidal math best practices
  - Profile and optimize chunk loading/unloading and seam rendering
  - Review all new features for toroidal compliance before merge
  - Onboard new contributors with best practices and usage examples
