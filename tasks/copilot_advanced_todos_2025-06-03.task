title: Advanced TODOs and Recommendations for Onboarding, Artifact Robustness, and Edge Cases
status: todo
priority: 3
tags: [todo, advanced, ai, onboarding, artifact, workflow, context, edge-case]
description: |
  - Enhance listScripts.js to include script descriptions, usage examples, and onboarding relevance
  - Add a guided onboarding script that walks a new agent through the most important artifacts, scripts, and conventions, and verifies understanding
  - Implement bi-directional code/artifact mapping
  - Add a script to warn if code references a non-canonical artifact version
  - Add a script to auto-update or prompt for artifact/code reference updates when artifacts are renamed or deleted
  - Add a script to visualize the artifact dependency/importance graph
  - Add a script to prompt for feedback/retrospective linkage when creating those artifacts, and update both sides with cross-links
  - Add a script to summarize and clean up unused or deprecated artifacts
  - Ensure seamless world looping at the tilemap seam
  - Refactor all world, chunk, AI, minimap, and rendering logic to use new toroidal math utilities
  - Expand copilot_memory.artifact with new heuristics, lessons, and context
  - Add a script to prompt for context/memory expansion when new systems or artifacts are added
  - Add checks for artifact deleted/renamed but still referenced in code; multiple artifacts with similar names; feedback artifacts not linked to their source; primer bloat; scripts added but not documented; AI agent starts with no context
