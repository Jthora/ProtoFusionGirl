title: Advanced/Best Practice TODOs for Toroidal World Logic and Reality Warping
status: todo
priority: 2
tags: [toroidal, world, math, reality-warping, effects, accessibility, ai, best-practices]
description: |
  - Consider vectorized/batch toroidal math utilities for large-scale AI/physics
  - Generalize toroidal math to 2D (vertical wrapping) if needed
  - Add floating-point precision handling for future floating-point world coordinates
  - Support custom distance metrics for advanced AI/pathfinding
  - Maintain artifact checklists and code comments for future contributors
  - Make effects configurable (color, duration, intensity)
  - Add accessibility options (disable/adjust effects)
  - Add fallback/warning for missing sound assets
  - Sequence effects and restoration for polish (e.g., delay restore until after effect)
  - Add hooks/events for effect testability
