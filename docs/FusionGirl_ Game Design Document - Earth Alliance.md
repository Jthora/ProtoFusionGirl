# Earth Alliance in Proto FusionGirl

## 1\. Overview of the Earth Alliance

The **Earth Alliance** stands as the pinnacle of human unity, innovation, and resilience in the face of multiversal threats. It was forged in the aftermath of the **Time Wars**, an era of chaotic temporal manipulation and geopolitical upheaval that reshaped the planet’s alliances and technologies. This coalition represents humanity’s determination to survive and thrive in an increasingly hostile and complex universe.

###### *The Earth Alliance was originally a PsyOp created by The Nefarium on Earth to prevent the population from actually trying to take the planet back from the interdimensional crime syndicate. Jono Tho’ra instead takes the idea and makes it a reality, resulting in the liberation of the planet\!*
