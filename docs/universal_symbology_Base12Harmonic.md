Course Set: {
	The Text Sample is filled with relationships for understanding different sets of Universal Symbols and their connections.

	There is a base mathematics that can match up with 12 tones in music theory, the 12 zodiac of astrology (4 Classical Elements x 3 Modalities)

	Lets look at classical astrology as more of a mystic art and dogmatic practice.

	Lets now produce an accurate astrology based more in astrophysics and geometric harmonics.

	We are going to figure out the naming system and sound system used to vocabularies universal symbology into a Universal Spoken Language for humans to other beings who know universal symbology.

	This means we need to accurately assign phonetics attributes to various attributes of the featural writing system.

	These sounds are based on basic principles of how sounds are made by the human mouth.

	Use the International Phonetic Alphabet and the Diagrams/Tables from the latest I.P.A. documentation to help you understand the full range of what potential sounds need to be covered for. Include table size even in cases where the I.P.A. documentation doesn't attribute for a specific sound (an empty cell) on the table's grid.

Think about how you can best tackle performing all of these tasks one at a time.
