# Progression Systems

## Introduction

The **Progression Systems** in Proto FusionGirl incorporate both traditional gameplay mechanics and the deeper **Universal Magic Balance System**, tying character growth and player choices to a dynamic, balanced framework. These systems encourage players to specialize in roles that resonate with their preferred playstyles while exploring the interplay between universal forces, crafting, and trading.

Progression is divided into **Skill Trees**, **Leveling Up**, and the application of the **Universal Magic Balance System**, ensuring that each step forward feels meaningful and integrated into the game’s multiversal narrative.

### Skill Trees

#### **Overview**:

* Players unlock abilities, traits, and skills through specialized trees that reflect their gameplay preferences and chosen role.  
* Trees are tailored to the **Universal Magic Balance System**, allowing players to align with one or more **Cosmic Forces** to unlock unique abilities.

#### **Tree Categories**:

* **Psionic Mastery** (Mental Resilience and Emotional Intelligence):  
  * Unlock abilities like emotional harmonization, psionic shields, and temporal manipulation.  
* **Economic Acumen** (Trading and Resource Control):  
  * Unlock skills to manipulate trade markets, reduce crafting costs, and increase trading profits.  
* **Crafting Expertise** (Item Creation and Customization):  
  * Unlock modular crafting recipes, item durability enhancements, and NFT design tools.  
* **Exploration and Discovery** (Ley Lines and Multiversal Travel):  
  * Unlock faster travel, ley line resonance mapping, and rare item detection.

# Leveling Up

* **Experience Points (XP)**:  
  * Players earn XP through:  
    * Completing missions (narrative, crafting, and exploration-based).  
    * Trading in the multiversal market.  
    * Solving challenges tied to the Universal Magic Balance System.  
* **Level Bonuses**:  
  * Each level rewards players with:  
    * **Skill Points**: Used to enhance specific abilities in the skill tree.  
    * **Inventory Slots**: Expanding capacity for rare items, NFTs, and resources.  
    * **Economy Unlocks**: Access to higher-tier crafting recipes or trade markets.  
* **Dynamic Leveling**:  
  * Progression reflects the balance rules of the **Universal Magic Balance System**:  
    * Choosing *Cardinal* abilities grants bonuses against *Mutable* challenges.  
    * Aligning with *Fire* provides advantages over *Air* adversaries.

## Universal Magic Balance System Integration

* ### **How It Works**:

  * Each ability, item, or decision aligns with a force from the **Cosmic Balance**:  
    * *Modality Balance*:   
      * Determines strengths and weaknesses based on player choices.  
    * *Nature Balance*:  
      *  Adds elemental strategy to crafting and combat.  
    * *Cosmic Balance*:   
      * Guides overarching narrative decisions and unlocks rare powers.

### **Example Progression Scenarios**:

* **Scenario 1**: A Psionic Specialist aligns with *Core Energy*:  
  * Gains abilities like temporal distortion and heat-based attacks.  
  * Weak to *Chaos Energy*, encouraging collaborative gameplay.  
* **Scenario 2**: A Crafting Innovator aligns with *Flux Energy)*:  
  * Excels in crafting fluid, adaptable items that work across multiple realities.  
  * Trades with *Order Energy* specialists to overcome crafting limitations.

# Balance in Progression

* **Role Interplay**:  
  * No role or force is inherently stronger than another, reflecting the **Balance Rules**:  
    * A *Cardinal* player (e.g., crafting-focused) can counter *Fixed* challenges (e.g., a trade market stalemate) but is vulnerable to *Mutable* situations (e.g., fluctuating trade values).  
* **Dynamic Specialization**:  
  * Players can choose hybrid paths to cover weaknesses but at the cost of slower specialization.
