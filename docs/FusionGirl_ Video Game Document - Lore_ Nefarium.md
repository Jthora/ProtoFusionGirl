# The Nefarium

In Proto FusionGirl, a primary antagonist is a corrupted cosmic consciousness: the Nefarium.

## What is the Nefarium?

The Nefarium is a collection of like minded individuals who have a corruption matrix installed into their neural networks. The Nefarium operates as a transdimensional crime syndicate that is supported by a super-cosmic drug trade and life-blood trafficking ring. Agents of the Nefarium can invade entire galactic clusters by corrupting the minds of critical leaders across the timeline using powerful dark magic and evil malefic rituals.

### Nether

Nether is considered a quantum field for shadow and destruction, directly opposed to Æther, which is a quantum field for light and creation.The Nefarium utilizes Nether to siphon power from naturally energy generating sources in living universes. Some of the best ways to siphon off energy is to corrupt beings that are normally aligned with Æther (like humans) and puppet them to subjugate their cultures to the whims of the Nefarium.

## Draken Seforthi

The Draken Seforthi is a Super-Cosmic Demon God Species; operating as the main antagonist force for the FusionGirl character and storyline. The Nefarium isn’t particularly allied with the Draken Seforthi, however the Nefarium is willing to sell out entire universes if they can squeeze some life-blood out of the deal to make a profit. As a result, the presence of the Nefarium only serves to complicate and exacerbate the Draken Seforthi problem. 

### Dimensional Rifts

Nefarium agents may attempt to exploit a Dimensional Rift and attempt to summon various malefic forces by stabilizing the Rift into an Interdimensional Portal.

More extreme cultists of the Nefarium have abandoned the transdimensional crime syndicate in favor of the Draken Seforthi’s coming to consume the universe. They will fool their fellow Nefarium cult members into opening a Portal to transport physical minions and bosses subjugated by the Draken Seforthi. This betrayal will usually peak just as the Portal opens.
