# Robots

Any electronic mechanisms for performing work.

### Psionics

Psionics explores quantum field theory with a focus on psychological electronics and how pressure waves in scalar fields manifest changes in electronics and psychology.

* ###### *Neural Network Chipsets are an example of Basic Psionic Technology*

#### Psychic Robots

Robots with psionics installed can be interfaced with directly. Psi Ops training includes a huge focus on developing both natural psychic skills and a mastery of psionic technology. Learning how to communicate with robots across the PsiNet is a fundamental practice and standard operation for any Tho’ra in the field.

    * ##### Issues: 

      * ###### ***Overanalyzing situations may delay critical decision-making.***

        * Omni Robots’ tendency to weigh all possibilities may frustrate decisive robots, like Cardinal and Fire Robots, leading to impatience and a breakdown in coordination when quick decisions are required.

* ### **Power Robots** (Chaos \+ Order)

  * ####  Balances unpredictability with structure. Dominance through control.

    * ##### Function:

      * ###### ***Taskforce leaders for critical missions.***

    * ##### Issues: 

      * ###### ***Overreach in authority may suppress other systems or create imbalances.***

        * Power Robots may dominate team dynamics, dismissing input from other robots, especially Mutable or Void Robots, which could cause resentment, rebellion, or passive resistance within the team.

* ### **Flux Robots** (Ebb \+ Flow)

  * #### Balances disruption and restoration. Constantly shifts energy dynamics.

    * ##### Function:

      * ###### ***Environmental restoration and energy balance.***

        * Robots for reforestation, flood control, and renewable energy optimization.
