# Priming Context

- Always read .primer and .datapack before automation.
- Use artifact_index.artifact and docs_index.json for fast lookup.
- If context is missing, create a feedback artifact in /tasks/.
- Respect persona boundaries from .persona.
- Summarize recent changes from artifact_index.artifact.
