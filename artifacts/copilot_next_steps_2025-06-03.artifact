# Copilot Next-Step TODOs (2025-06-03)

## Verification & Utility
- [ ] **Verify artifact index automation:**
    - Run `node scripts/generateArtifactIndex.js` after adding/editing artifacts and confirm all new/updated artifacts are indexed.
    - Add a test artifact and check for its presence in the index, then remove it and confirm removal.
- [ ] **Verify directory snapshot utility:**
    - Run `node scripts/snapshotDirectory.js` after major structure changes and confirm the snapshot matches the actual directory.
    - Compare two snapshots to ensure changes are accurately reflected.
- [ ] **Test meta-script discovery:**
    - Run `node scripts/listScripts.js` and confirm all scripts are listed with clear descriptions.
    - Add a new script and verify it appears in the list.
- [ ] **Check artifact/code linkage:**
    - Review code files for artifact reference comments and ensure they point to the correct, up-to-date artifacts.
    - Update or add missing references as needed.

## Expanding AI Memory & Context
- [ ] **Implement artifact search/recall script:**
    - Create a script (e.g., `scripts/searchArtifacts.js`) to search artifacts by tag, type, or keyword for rapid context recall.
    - Test by searching for design, feedback, or retrospective artifacts.
- [ ] **Enable artifact cross-referencing:**
    - Add or update `related` fields in artifact headers to form a navigable web of context.
    - Create a script to visualize or list artifact relationships.
- [ ] **Automate artifact versioning:**
    - Implement a simple versioning system for key artifacts (e.g., append version/timestamp to filename or header).
    - Test restoring or comparing previous artifact versions.
- [ ] **Enhance feedback/retrospective loop:**
    - After each major change, prompt for a feedback or retrospective artifact and link it to the relevant code/artifacts.
    - Summarize lessons learned and next steps in each retrospective.

## Automation & Self-Service
- [ ] **Script for artifact/code sync check:**
    - Create a script to scan code for artifact references and verify the referenced artifacts exist and are current.
    - Report missing or outdated references for follow-up.
- [ ] **Onboarding/primer auto-update:**
    - Automate updating the primer with new artifact highlights, directory snapshots, and onboarding steps after major changes.
    - Test by adding a new system and confirming the primer reflects it.
- [ ] **Memory expansion artifact:**
    - Create a dedicated artifact (e.g., `copilot_memory.artifact`) to store persistent, high-value context, heuristics, and lessons for the AI agent.
    - Reference this artifact in all future automation and onboarding scripts.
