# Ley Line Instability Event Test Plan

## Unit Tests
- Event generation in `CosmicEnvSimulation` (simulateTick triggers instability)
- State mutation and persistence in `WorldStateManager`
- Event emission and propagation in `MultiverseEventEngine`
- Event handling in `LeyLineSystem` (activation, stabilization, escalation)
- UI feedback and overlay updates in `UIManager` and `Minimap`
- Pathfinding adaptation in `LeyLinePathfinder`

## Integration Tests
- End-to-end: Simulate instability, propagate through event system, verify world state and UI
- Branch/timeline divergence: Instability in one branch does not affect others
- Mission/narrative triggers: Instability event triggers mission objectives or narrative hooks

## Edge Cases
- Simultaneous instability events on adjacent ley lines
- Rapid escalation/resolution cycles
- Player attempts to stabilize during surge/disruption
- Timeline merge/rollback with conflicting instability states

## Manual Playtest Checklist
- Instability events are visible and understandable to the player
- UI overlays and minimap update correctly
- Player can interact with unstable ley lines (stabilize, escalate, exploit)
- Narrative and mission integration is clear and functional
