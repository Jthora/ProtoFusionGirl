# Ley Line System Unification & Refactor Plan

## Objective
Unify all ley line data models, management, and logic into a single, canonical system to eliminate redundancy, reduce bugs, and streamline future development.

## Steps

1. **Data Model Unification**
   - Adopt the `LeyLine` and `LeyLineNode` interfaces from `WorldStateManager.ts` as the canonical model.
   - Refactor all modules to use this model. Migrate or remove alternate definitions.

2. **Network Management Consolidation**
   - Merge `LeyLineManager` and `LeyLineNetwork` into a single manager/service.
   - Ensure this manager handles all ley line queries, updates, procedural generation, and visualization hooks.

3. **Centralize Activation & Event Logic**
   - Move all ley line activation and event publishing logic into the unified manager.
   - Ensure all event hooks and activation logic are handled in one place.

4. **Single Source for Pathfinding & Traversal**
   - Implement ley line-aware pathfinding in the unified manager.
   - Remove duplicate or stub pathfinding logic elsewhere.

5. **Update All References**
   - Refactor all code (Jane, MagnetoSpeeder, WorldTraversalSystem, etc.) to use the unified manager and data model.
   - Update tests and documentation.

6. **Remove Redundant Files/Code**
   - Delete or archive obsolete files and interfaces after migration.

## Definition of Done
- Only one set of ley line/node interfaces exists.
- Only one manager/service handles all ley line logic.
- All activation, event, and pathfinding logic is centralized.
- All references in the codebase use the unified system.
- All tests pass and documentation is up to date.
