# Ley Line System Design

## Overview
- Modular ley line generation, node management, and visualization.
- Real-world data and procedural generation for replayability.
- API for modding and in-game editing.
- Artifact cross-referencing for discoverability.

## Key Components
- Ley line generator (procedural + real-world data)
- Node manager (placement, state, upgrades)
- Visualization (2D/3D, overlays, UI)
- Modding API (external and in-game)

## API Contracts
- `LeyLineNode` interface: `{ id: string, position: { x: number, y: number }, state: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'unstable', upgrades?: string[] }`
- `LeyLine` interface: `{ id: string, nodes: [string, string], strength: number }`
- Methods: `generateNetwork(seed?: number)`, `addNode(node)`, `addLine(line)`, `getNodeById(id)`, `getConnectedNodes(id)`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Can generate a network with N nodes and M lines
- [ ] Nodes and lines are discoverable via API
- [ ] Visualization overlays display correct state
- [ ] Modding API allows adding/removing nodes/lines at runtime
- [ ] All changes are reflected in artifacts and documentation

## Example Usage
```ts
const system = new LeyLineSystem();
system.generateNetwork(42);
system.addNode({ id: 'A', position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, state: 'active' });
```

## Milestones
- Prototype generator
- Node management module
- Visualization integration
- Modding hooks
- Artifact/documentation cross-linking

## Required Tests
- Unit tests for node/line creation
- Integration tests for network generation
- API contract tests
