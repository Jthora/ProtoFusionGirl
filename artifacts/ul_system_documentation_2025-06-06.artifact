# Universal Language (UL) System Documentation

## Overview
The Universal Language (UL) system provides a data-driven, extensible framework for puzzles, symbols, grammar, and animations in ProtoFusionGirl. It is fully integrated with player, mission, world, and AI systems via a standardized event bus.

## Architecture & Integration Points
- **Resource Loader**: Loads and validates UL puzzles, symbols, grammar, and animations from core and mod directories.
- **Sandboxed Scripting**: All puzzle scripts are executed in a secure, sandboxed environment.
- **Event Bus**: Standardized events (`ul:puzzle:completed`, `ul:puzzle:validated`, etc.) connect UL actions to gameplay, UI, analytics, and other systems.
- **Cross-System Hooks**: PlayerManager, MissionSystem, WorldStateManager, and ASIController all listen for UL events and react accordingly.

## Adding/Modding UL Content
- Place new puzzles, symbols, grammar, or animations in the appropriate JSON format in `data/ul/` (core) or `src/mods/` (mods).
- Modded content must use unique, namespaced IDs and include `metadata.mod` or `metadata.author`.
- All resources are validated for schema, uniqueness, and safety.

## Event System
- Subscribe to UL events via `ulEventBus`:
  - `ul:puzzle:loaded`, `ul:puzzle:validated`, `ul:puzzle:completed`
  - `ul:symbol:loaded`, `ul:animation:loaded`, etc.
- Payloads include resource IDs, metadata, validation results, and errors.
- See `src/ul/ulEventBus.ts` for event types and usage.

## Integration Examples
- **PlayerManager**: Grants rewards or triggers effects on puzzle completion.
- **MissionSystem**: Advances or branches missions based on UL puzzle outcomes.
- **WorldStateManager**: Unlocks areas or changes environment when specific puzzles are solved.
- **ASIController**: Adapts AI/ASI behavior in response to UL events.

## Testing & Validation
- Automated tests cover resource loading, validation, event emission, and modding.
- See `src/ul/__tests__/ulResourceLoader.test.ts` for examples.
- All mods must pass schema and safety checks before being loaded.
