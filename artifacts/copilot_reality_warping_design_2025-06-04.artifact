# Reality Warping System Design (2025-06-04)

## Purpose
Integrate reality warping (warp anchors/zones) as a core Universal Magic mechanic, tightly coupled with the Timestream Framework, Universal Language, and player agency. Enable anchor sharing, multiplayer, and narrative consequences.

## Key Features
- Warp anchors/zones as Universal Magic manifestations (not just tech)
- Anchor creation/restoration requires Universal Language puzzles or rituals
- Overuse/misuse of warping causes timeline instability, NPC/faction reactions, or cosmic threats
- Anchor sharing as "quantum bookmarks" (tradable, discoverable, multiplayer-enabled)
- Anchors interact with Timestream Framework (timeline branches, mission/faction unlocks)
- Robust, accessible, and customizable UI/UX for anchor management
- Modding hooks for new anchor types, effects, and Universal Language puzzles

## Technical Notes
- Strong serialization, hashing, and validation for anchor data
- Configurable visual/audio effects (cosmic, harmonic, symbol-based)
- Automated tests for edge cases, multiplayer, and anchor sharing
- Accessibility options for all major effects

## Next Steps
1. Deepen anchor/warping integration with Universal Magic and Timestream
2. Build collaborative/competitive anchor sharing and multiplayer support
3. Polish UI/UX, accessibility, and modding hooks
4. Expand procedural content and narrative branching via anchors
5. Iterate with player feedback and community-driven content
