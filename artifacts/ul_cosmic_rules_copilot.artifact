# Canonical Universal Language Cosmic Rules (Copilot Migration)

## Purpose
Single, machine-readable source of truth for all cosmic forces, relationships, cycles, and combinations. Used for code/test generation and validation.

## Format (JSON Object)
```json
{
  "forces": ["Core", "Void", "Order", "Chaos", "..."],
  "modality_cycles": [["Cardinal", "Mutable", "Fixed", "Cardinal"]],
  "elemental_cycles": [["Fire", "Air", "Water", "Earth", "Fire"]],
  "relationships": [
    {"beats": ["Core", "Chaos"]},
    {"beats": ["Chaos", "Void"]}
  ],
  "combinations": [
    {"elements": ["Fire", "Air"], "result": "Angle"}
  ]
}
```

## Update Instructions
- Update only via migration scripts or Copilot-driven refactor.
- All code, tests, and docs must reference this as the canonical cosmic rules source.
