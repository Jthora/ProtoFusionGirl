# Phase 1: Brainstorming Notes

## Game Vision
- Fusion of action RPG and procedural world generation.
- Modular systems for combat, crafting, and AI.

## Key Features
- Tilemap-based world with dynamic chunk loading.
- Modding support via JSON and scriptable modules.
- Persistent world state and player progression.

## Open Questions
- How to structure mod registry for extensibility?
- What data format is best for world persistence?

## Next Steps
- Draft tilemap system pseudocode. (See: tilemap_system_design.artifact)
- Research ECS (Entity Component System) patterns for gameplay logic.
