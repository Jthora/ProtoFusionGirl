# Timestreams & Warp Zones: Integration Design (2025-06-04)

## Relationship
- Warp anchors/zones are timeline anchors: using one creates a new branch or restores a previous state
- Timestream Framework tracks all timeline branches, anchor uses, and narrative consequences
- Overuse/misuse of anchors can destabilize the timestream, causing cosmic threats or NPC/faction reactions

## Gameplay
- Anchor use can unlock/lock missions, factions, or world states
- Timeline branches are visualized and explorable (e.g., minimap, timeline UI)
- Anchor sharing enables cross-reality collaboration and competition

## Technical
- Anchor actions trigger Timestream Framework events
- All anchor/timestream changes are logged and can be replayed or analyzed
