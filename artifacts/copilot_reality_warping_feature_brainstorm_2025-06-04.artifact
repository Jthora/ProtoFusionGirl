## Reality Warping Feature: Brainstorm & Design

### Core Concepts
- **Warp Zone:** A rectangular region (3x visible screen) of tiles, including all tile codes, states, and metadata.
- **Warp Anchor:** A snapshot of the current warp zone, saved as a datablob (all tile data + metadata).
- **Datakey/Seed:** The datablob is hashed or encoded to create a unique seed for procedural world generation.
- **Reality Return:** Returning to a warp anchor restores the exact tile state and world context of that zone.

### Key Questions
- How to efficiently serialize/deserialize tile grid data (including metadata) for a warp zone?
- How to handle toroidal wrapping when a warp zone crosses the world seam?
- How to store, index, and retrieve multiple warp anchors per player?
- How to visualize warp zones and anchors in the UI (minimap overlay, markers, etc.)?
- How to allow sharing or remixing of warp anchors (datakey exchange)?
- How to provide advanced, configurable, and accessible visual/sound effects for warping?
- How to test and sequence effects for polish and accessibility?

### Technical Steps
1. Define a data structure for warp zone tile data (2D array of tile objects: code, state, metadata).
2. Implement serialization (to datablob) and deserialization (from datablob) for warp zones.
3. Create a hash or encoding function to generate a unique datakey/seed from the datablob.
4. Integrate with worldgen: allow world generation to use a datakey/seed to reconstruct a warp zone.
5. Add UI for creating, selecting, and visualizing warp anchors.
6. Handle edge cases: seam crossing, overlapping anchors, persistence, and multiplayer.
7. Add advanced, configurable, and accessible visual/sound effects for warping.
8. Add hooks/events for effect testability.

## Best Practices for Reality Warping & Warp Zones
- Use minimal, lossless serialization for tile data (avoid unnecessary bloat)
- Always include tile metadata and state in the datablob
- Use a strong, fast hash for datakey/seed generation (e.g., SHA-256, MurmurHash)
- When serializing across the seam, use toroidal math to ensure correct wrap-around
- Store warp anchors with timestamps and player context for easy retrieval
- Visualize warp zones and anchors clearly in the UI (minimap, overlays, tooltips)
- Allow for modding/extension: custom tile types, metadata, and warp effects
- Test with large and edge-case warp zones (crossing seam, max size, etc.)
- Make visual/sound effects configurable and accessible (user settings, effect parameters)
- Provide fallbacks or warnings for missing sound assets
- Sequence effects and restoration for polish (e.g., delay restore until after effect)
- Add hooks/events for effect testability
