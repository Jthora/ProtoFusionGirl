## Best Practices for Reality Warping & Warp Zones
- Use minimal, lossless serialization for tile data (avoid unnecessary bloat)
- Always include tile metadata and state in the datablob
- Use a strong, fast hash for datakey/seed generation (e.g., SHA-256, MurmurHash)
- When serializing across the seam, use toroidal math to ensure correct wrap-around
- Store warp anchors with timestamps and player context for easy retrieval
- Visualize warp zones and anchors clearly in the UI (minimap, overlays, tooltips)
- Allow for modding/extension: custom tile types, metadata, and warp effects
- Test with large and edge-case warp zones (crossing seam, max size, etc.)
- Make visual/sound effects configurable and accessible (user settings, effect parameters)
- Provide fallbacks or warnings for missing sound assets
- Sequence effects and restoration for polish (e.g., delay restore until after effect)
- Add hooks/events for effect testability
