# Copilot Feedback & Blockers Log (2025-06-05)

## 2025-06-05
- Initial artifact generation: Roadmap, feature matrix, context index, and missing systems checklist created.
- Blocker: No concrete Jane/FusionGirl class or AI exists; PlayerManager and ASIController are stubs.
- Blocker: No inventory, crafting, or dialogue systems implemented.
- Feedback: MissionSystem and WorldStateManager are extensible but lack real content and integration.
- Lesson: Anchoring all new work to artifacts and cross-linking context accelerates onboarding and reduces confusion.
