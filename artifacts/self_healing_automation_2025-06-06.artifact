# Self-Healing & Automation

## Goals
- Automated onboarding, validation, and context sync
- Self-healing for missing/broken data
- Feedback artifact generation

## Steps
- Script automation for all core systems
- Error detection and auto-repair
- Feedback loop integration
- Artifact/documentation sync

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All core systems have automated validation scripts
- [ ] Errors are detected and auto-repaired or escalated
- [ ] Feedback artifacts are generated for every critical issue

## Example Usage
- "Run validation scripts after every build; if a ley line node is missing, auto-generate a repair task and feedback artifact."

## Required Tests
- Unit tests for validation scripts
- Integration tests for error detection and repair
- Artifact sync tests
