# Holistic Testing System Solutions Artifact (Upgraded)

## Summary
By centralizing mocks/fixtures, enforcing event contracts, expanding scenario/integration tests, automating coverage, and improving documentation, the testing system will become more robust, maintainable, and aligned with artifact-driven development. This will also make it easier to fill in the TODOs and ensure high-quality, reliable code across all modules.

---

## Prioritization & Roadmap
1. **Centralize Mocks & Test Utilities** (High Impact, Unblocks Others)
2. **Centralize Test Data/Fixtures** (High Impact, Unblocks Others)
3. **Event Bus Helpers & Contract Tests** (Critical for event-driven modules)
4. **Automate Coverage Reporting** (Immediate feedback, CI integration)
5. **Expand Scenario/Integration Tests** (Cross-system reliability)
6. **Generate & Maintain Test Index** (Traceability, onboarding)
7. **Automate Edge/Error Case Test Generation** (Completeness)
8. **Update Documentation & Onboarding** (Sustains improvements)

## Key Solutions (with Ownership, Metrics, Next Steps)

### 1. Centralized Mocking & Test Utilities
- **Owner:** [Assign: Core Test Maintainer]
- **Deadline:** 1 week
- **Success Metric:** 80%+ of new/updated tests use shared utils
- **Next Steps:**
  - Create `test/utils/` directory
  - Move/create reusable mocks (Phaser, EventBus, world state, etc.)
  - Provide factory functions for common test objects

### 2. Test Data & Fixture Centralization
- **Owner:** [Assign: Test Data Lead]
- **Deadline:** 1 week
- **Success Metric:** 80%+ of tests reference fixtures
- **Next Steps:**
  - Create `test/fixtures/` directory
  - Add canonical test data (world state, tilemaps, ley lines, etc.)
  - Refactor tests to use fixtures

### 3. Event Bus & Contract Testing
- **Owner:** [Assign: Event System Lead]
- **Deadline:** 2 weeks
- **Success Metric:** 100% of event types have contract tests
- **Next Steps:**
  - Implement shared helpers to capture/assert event emissions
  - Add contract tests for all major event types
  - Use TS types and runtime checks for payloads

### 4. Automated Coverage & Reporting
- **Owner:** [Assign: CI/DevOps Lead]
- **Deadline:** 1 week
- **Success Metric:** Coverage reports generated on every CI run; <10% untested code flagged
- **Next Steps:**
  - Integrate Jest coverage into CI/pre-commit
  - Output coverage reports to `artifacts/`
  - Flag/report coverage gaps

### 5. Scenario & Integration Test Expansion
- **Owner:** [Assign: Integration Test Lead]
- **Deadline:** 2-3 weeks
- **Success Metric:** All major cross-system flows have scenario tests
- **Next Steps:**
  - Add integration tests for UI ↔ world, tilemap ↔ ley lines, etc.
  - Use modular game loop to drive scenario tests
  - Document scenario coverage in test index

### 6. Test Index & Traceability
- **Owner:** [Assign: Artifact/Traceability Lead]
- **Deadline:** 2 weeks
- **Success Metric:** All tests mapped in `test_index.artifact`
- **Next Steps:**
  - Generate/maintain `test_index.artifact` mapping tests to modules/scenarios/artifacts
  - Use index for audits, onboarding, and coverage improvement

### 7. Error & Edge Case Automation
- **Owner:** [Assign: Edge Case Automation Lead]
- **Deadline:** 3 weeks
- **Success Metric:** 90%+ of modules have automated edge/error case tests
- **Next Steps:**
  - Define checklist of required edge/error cases for each module
  - Automate generation of these tests where possible

### 8. Documentation & Onboarding
- **Owner:** [Assign: Docs/Onboarding Lead]
- **Deadline:** 2 weeks
- **Success Metric:** All new contributors can follow onboarding to add/expand tests
- **Next Steps:**
  - Update onboarding docs and `README.md` in `test/` and `artifacts/`
  - Reference artifacts and test plans in all new/expanded test files

---

## Feedback Loop & Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular (monthly/quarterly) audits using the test index and coverage reports
- Log gaps and improvement tasks as issues/artifacts
- Review and update this artifact after each audit or major change
- Solicit feedback from contributors and update onboarding as needed

---

## Next Steps
- Assign owners and deadlines for each solution
- Begin with test utils and fixture centralization
- Expand scenario/integration tests and automate coverage reporting
- Update onboarding and documentation to reflect new testing conventions
- Track progress and iterate using the feedback loop
