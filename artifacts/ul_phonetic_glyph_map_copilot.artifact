# Canonical Universal Language Phonetic & Glyph Map (Copilot Migration)

## Purpose
Single, machine-readable source of truth for symbol-to-phonetic and glyph mappings. Used for code/test generation and validation.

## Format (JSON Array)
```json
[
  {
    "ul_symbol": "point",
    "ipa": "pɔɪnt",
    "glyph": "•",
    "sound_group": "plosive"
  }
  // ...more mappings
]
```

## Update Instructions
- Update only via migration scripts or Copilot-driven refactor.
- All code, tests, and docs must reference this as the canonical phonetic/glyph map.
