# Modding & Extensibility Artifact

## Purpose
Define extension points and modding APIs for community and future-proofing.

## Mod/Plugin Architecture Overview
- Mods are loaded from the `mods/` directory
- Mods can register new data (skills, cosmetics, factions, narrative events)
- Mods can hook into events via the EventBus

## Data-Driven Extension Guidelines
- Mods should add content via JSON/config files
- Provide schema validation for mod data

## Example Mod Integration
- Sample mod that adds a new skill and cosmetic
- Example of mod listening for `JANE_LEVEL_UP` and triggering a custom event

## API Documentation
- Document public modding APIs and extension points
