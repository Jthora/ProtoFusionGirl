# Timestream Framework: Serialization & State Management

## Serialization Challenges
- Deterministic serialization of world state (chunks, entities, player, environment).
- Efficient diffing: store only what changed per branch/event.
- Hashing: Use strong hashes for branch/event IDs and world state validation.
- Backward compatibility for future updates.

## State Management
- Restore world state for any branch (full or partial).
- Support for partial warps: only restore affected chunks/entities.
- Tools for diffing, merging, and replaying state changes.
