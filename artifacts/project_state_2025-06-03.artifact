# Project State & Next Steps (2025-06-03)

## Current State
- Artifact-driven, automation-first project structure is in place.
- All major scripts for artifact indexing, search, versioning, onboarding, and code sync are implemented and tested.
- Persistent memory and onboarding artifacts exist for both AI and human contributors.
- All artifacts are cross-referenced and indexed.

## Open Questions
- How should artifact versioning be handled for canonical vs. historical artifacts?
- What is the best way to visualize artifact/code relationships for large projects?
- How can onboarding be further streamlined for new AI agents?
- Are there any unused or deprecated artifacts that should be archived or deleted?

## Next Priorities
- Implement bi-directional code/artifact mapping and visualization.
- Enhance onboarding with a guided script and self-test for new agents.
- Add script documentation and usage examples to all automation scripts.
- Regularly review and clean up unused or outdated artifacts.
- Expand `copilot_memory.artifact` with new lessons and heuristics as the project evolves.
- Refactor all world, chunk, AI, minimap, and rendering logic to use new toroidal math utilities for robust edge-aware behavior (see task_apply_toroidal_utilities_everywhere_2025-06-04.artifact).
