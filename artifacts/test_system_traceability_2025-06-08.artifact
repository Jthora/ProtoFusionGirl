# Test System Traceability Guidelines

- Reference related artifacts in test file headers and comments
- Use artifact IDs in test descriptions for scenario and requirement mapping
- Document test coverage and gaps in dedicated audit artifacts
- Link scenario/edge case tests to their `TestPlan.ts` or artifact source
- Update traceability as code and artifacts evolve
