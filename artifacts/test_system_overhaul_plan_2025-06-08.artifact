# Test System Overhaul Plan

## Goals
- Achieve 80%+ code coverage for all core systems
- Automate and enforce testing at every stage (pre-commit, CI, onboarding)
- Mirror `src/` structure in `test/` for clarity and maintainability
- Integrate artifact-driven, scenario-based, and edge case testing
- Improve reporting, traceability, and feedback loops

## Phases
1. Audit current test coverage and structure
2. Expand and unify test suites (unit, integration, scenario)
3. Automate coverage reporting and enforce in CI/pre-commit
4. Link tests to artifacts for traceability
5. Regularly audit and improve test quality
