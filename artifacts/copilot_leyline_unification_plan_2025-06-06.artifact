# ProtoFusionGirl: Ley Line & World/Event System Unification Plan (2025-06-06)

## Purpose
Step-by-step plan for deduplication, event contract enforcement, and migration of legacy code in world, ley line, and event systems.

## Steps
1. Audit all modules for direct state mutation or caching outside WorldStateManager.
2. Refactor all state access to go through WorldStateManager.
3. Remove all legacy/local event bus code; use only core/EventBus.
4. Refactor all event emission/subscription to use strong event contract.
5. Deduplicate traversal, movement, and energy logic into a shared system.
6. Refactor editing, generation, and traversal to emit events via EventBus and update state via WorldStateManager.
7. Remove unused/legacy files and APIs.
8. Validate with tests after each major change.
