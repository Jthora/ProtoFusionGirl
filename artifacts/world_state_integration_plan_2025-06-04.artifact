# World State Integration & Migration Plan

## Inventory of Current Systems
- Missions/Quests
- Tilemap/WorldGen
- Player/Inventory/Progression
- Economy/Crafting
- Reality Warping
- Modding/AI APIs

## Staged Rollout
1. Implement EventBus and WorldStateManager (core only)
2. Integrate with Missions/Quests (event-driven objectives)
3. Refactor Player/Inventory to use world state
4. Migrate Economy/Crafting to world state
5. Add Ley Line/Rift state and event integration
6. Expose API for AI/Mods
7. Remove legacy state management

## Refactoring Guidelines
- Use adapters/wrappers for gradual migration
- Write integration tests for each phase
- Maintain backward compatibility until all systems migrated
- Document all API changes and event types in their respective artifacts
- Update onboarding and modding docs as you go

## Risk Assessment & Rollback
- Identify critical paths and dependencies
- Use feature flags for new system
- Keep legacy code until new system is validated
- Document all changes and update onboarding

## Versioning & Migration
- Track state and event schema versions
- Provide migration scripts for breaking changes
- Use feature flags for new system
