## Purpose
Defines the testing strategy, folder structure, and conventions for ProtoFusionGirl.

## Test Structure
- Mirror `src/` structure in `test/` or `__tests__/` for unit/integration tests
- Each domain/module has its own test suite

## Coverage Goals
- 80%+ code coverage for all core systems
- Critical gameplay and narrative paths must be tested

## Example Test Cases
- Jane leveling up triggers correct events and stat changes
- Narrative triggers fire on correct conditions
- Combat system resolves outcomes as expected

## TDD & CI Guidelines
- Write tests before/with new features
- Integrate with CI for automatic test runs on PRs
