## Overview
Holo Tech is a pivotal tech level in ProtoFusionGirl, unlocking simulation mastery, advanced holographic gear, and new mission types. This artifact details the mechanics, unlocks, and narrative hooks for Holo Tech.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- Unlocks holo-environments, holo-gear, and simulation-based missions.
- Enables reality manipulation and custom simulation generation.
- New enemy types and hazards unique to holographic realms.
- Holo Gear and skills (e.g., Holo Shield) become available in inventory and skill trees.
- Holo Simulation Chamber zone is accessible.

## User Stories
- As a player, I want to unlock Holo Tech so I can access new simulation missions and use advanced holo-gear.
- As a faction leader, I want my faction to reach Holo Tech so all members benefit from shared unlocks.
- As a modder, I want to add new Holo Tech unlocks and missions via JSON and scripts.
- As a UI/UX designer, I want to display the current tech level and Holo Tech unlocks to the player.

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes
- Regression: If a catastrophic event (e.g., simulation collapse) occurs, Holo Tech unlocks are removed and narrative consequences are triggered.
- Multiplayer: Simultaneous unlocks by multiple factions must be resolved without conflict.
- Modding: Invalid or duplicate tech level IDs must be rejected by validation scripts.
- Save/Load: Tech level state and unlocks must persist across sessions.

## Explicit Requirements
- [ ] Players can access and deploy holo-gear and environments via UI and inventory.
- [ ] New missions and narrative content become available at Holo Tech (see narrative.json).
- [ ] Holo Tech unlocks are reflected in WorldStateManager and RealityWarpSystem.
- [ ] Regression from Holo Tech disables holo features and triggers narrative consequences.
- [ ] Multiplayer: Faction-wide unlocks sync correctly.
- [ ] Modding: New holo unlocks can be added via JSON and validated (see tech_level_modding_api_2025-06-08.artifact).
- [ ] UI/UX: Current tech level and unlocks are displayed to the player.
- [ ] All requirements are covered by tests in tech_level_test_plan_2025-06-08.artifact.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All explicit requirements above are met and validated by automated tests and manual review.
