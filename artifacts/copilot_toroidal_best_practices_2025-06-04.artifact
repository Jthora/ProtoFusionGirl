# Toroidal Math Best Practices

## Principles
- Always use wrapping utilities for X/Y logic in world, chunk, and minimap code.
- Prefer wrapping over clamping for seamless world experience.
- Test all edge cases, especially at world seams and chunk boundaries.
- Consistency: All systems (AI, UI, physics, persistence) must use the same wrapping logic.

## Guidelines
- Audit all code that manipulates world/chunk coordinates (search for direct arithmetic).
- Refactor to use `wrapX`, `wrapChunkX`, `toroidalDistanceX`, etc.
- Document any exceptions or special cases (e.g., UI overlays, debug tools).
- Add/expand tests for seam/edge cases and negative/overflow values.
- Review all new features for toroidal compliance during code review.

## Common Pitfalls
- Off-by-one errors at seams or chunk edges.
- Forgetting to wrap after arithmetic operations or when looping.
- Inconsistent use of wrapping in different systems (AI vs. rendering).
- Failing to update tests/documentation after refactor.

## Checklist
- [ ] All world/chunk X logic uses wrapping utilities
- [ ] All AI/pathfinding logic uses toroidal math
- [ ] Minimap and rendering logic are seam-aware
- [ ] Tests cover seam/edge cases and negative/overflow values
- [ ] Documentation and onboarding updated

## Onboarding Notes
- Reference this artifact and usage examples when implementing or reviewing world logic.
- New contributors should review this checklist before submitting changes to world/chunk logic.
- Link to related artifacts for deeper context and code examples.
