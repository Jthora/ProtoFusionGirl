# Narrative & Feedback Integration

## Action Consequences
- Immediate: Mission outcomes, world state changes, UI feedback (distinct for ASI and Jane actions).
- Delayed: Branching narratives, evolving realities, community recognition, changes to Janeâ€™s emotional state, ASI/Jane relationship, and multiversal state.
- Consequences may differ depending on whether actions are taken by the ASI (player) or Jane (autonomous agent), supporting the duality described in the gameplay blueprint.

## Feedback Mechanisms
- Event-driven updates to UI and world state, routed through context-aware overlays for both ASI and Jane.
- Serialization/versioning for persistent narrative and world changes, including relationship and emotional state tracking.
- Feedback is context-sensitive: ASI receives strategic/world feedback, Jane receives personal/emotional/narrative feedback.

## Narrative Hooks
- Triggers for story events, cutscenes, alternate endings, and ASI/Jane collaboration moments.
- Analytics and recognition for player (ASI) and Jane contributions, including multiversal impact and community outcomes.
