# Canonical Universal Language Grammar Rules (Copilot Migration)

## Purpose
Single, machine-readable source of truth for all UL grammar, axioms, deduction rules, and validation patterns. Used for code/test generation and validation.

## Format (JSON Object)
```json
{
  "symbols": ["point(x)", "line(x)", "circle(x)", "..."],
  "predicates": ["contains(x, y)", "adjacent(x, y)", "..."],
  "functions": ["transform(T, x)", "intersection(x, y)"],
  "constants": ["O"],
  "axioms": [
    "∀x (point(x) ∨ line(x) ∨ ...)",
    "∀x ¬(point(x) ∧ line(x))"
  ],
  "deduction_rules": [
    "Conjunction Introduction: from φ, ψ infer φ ∧ ψ"
  ],
  "validation_patterns": {
    "well_formed_formula": "First-order logic syntax with allowed predicates, functions, and quantifiers."
  },
  "edge_cases": [
    "Degenerate: circle(x) ∧ radius(x,0) → point(x)"
  ]
}
```

## Update Instructions
- Update only via migration scripts or Copilot-driven refactor.
- All code, tests, and docs must reference this as the canonical grammar source.
