# Architecture Blueprint Artifact

## Purpose
Defines the high-level architecture for ProtoFusionGirl, including domain boundaries, event flow, data-driven principles, and integration patterns.

## Domain Model Diagram (Textual)
- Characters (Jane, Companions, Enemies)
- Combat System
- Narrative System
- World/Timeline System
- Customization System
- UI/UX
- Data Layer (JSON/config)
- Event Bus (core communication)

## Event-Driven Communication
- All major systems emit/listen to events via a central EventBus.
- Example: Jane emits `JANE_LEVEL_UP`, UI and Narrative listen and react.

## Data-Driven Design
- Game content (skills, cosmetics, factions, narrative) is loaded from JSON/config files.
- Systems are designed to be extended by adding new data, not new code.

## Service Locator/Context
- Shared systems (inventory, narrative, world state) are accessed via a central context/service locator.

## Example Folder Structure
- See domain-driven structure in previous recommendations.

## Integration Patterns
- Use interfaces and events for decoupling.
- Barrel files (`index.ts`) for each domain.
- README.md in each folder for documentation.
