# Advanced Ley Line System Development Plan

## Objective
Create a robust, modular, and extensible ley line system that supports procedural generation, advanced pathfinding, dynamic events, and seamless integration with traversal/gameplay systems (Jane, MagnetoSpeeder, etc.).

## Key Principles
- **Single Source of Truth:** All ley line data and logic centralized in canonical manager and interfaces.
- **Modularity:** Separate concerns for pathfinding, procedural generation, events, and visualization.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new features (e.g., ley line manipulation, AI, advanced events).
- **Testability:** Each module and integration point is covered by unit/integration tests.
- **Artifact-Driven:** All code, docs, and PRs reference this and related artifacts.

## Directory Structure (Target)
```
src/
  world/
    leyline/
      LeyLineManager.ts
      pathfinding/
        LeyLinePathfinder.ts
      procedural/
        LeyLineProceduralGen.ts
      events/
        LeyLineEvents.ts
      visualization/
        LeyLineVisualization.ts
  legacy/
    leyLines.ts
```

## Development Steps (Prioritized)
1. **Directory & Codebase Cleanup**
   - Move all deprecated ley line code to `legacy/`.
   - Scaffold modular folders under `src/world/leyline/`.
2. **Data Model & Manager Refactor**
   - Ensure only one canonical data model.
   - Refactor `LeyLineManager` to integrate with new submodules.
3. **Procedural Generation**
   - Implement ley line network generation (graph-based, world seed support).
4. **Robust Pathfinding**
   - Implement A*, Dijkstra, or similar algorithms for ley line-aware traversal.
5. **Dynamic Events**
   - Add hooks for activation, surges, disruptions, manipulation.
6. **Visualization Hooks**
   - Provide APIs for UI overlays and debugging ley line networks.
7. **Consumer Refactor**
   - Update Jane, MagnetoSpeeder, WorldTraversalSystem, etc. to use only the new manager and APIs.
8. **Testing & Validation**
   - Expand and update tests for all modules and edge cases.
9. **Documentation & Artifact Sync**
   - Update all docs, onboarding, and code comments to reference this artifact and the new structure.

## Definition of Done
- All ley line logic is modular, robust, and testable.
- Only one canonical data model and manager exist.
- Advanced features (procedural, pathfinding, events, visualization) are implemented and documented.
- All consumers use the new APIs.
- All tests pass and documentation is up to date.
- All code and docs reference this artifact and the unification plan.
