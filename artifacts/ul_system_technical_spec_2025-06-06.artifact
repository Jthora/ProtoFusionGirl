# Universal Language (UL) System: Technical Specification

## Purpose
Defines the architecture, core components, and integration points for the Universal Language (UL) system in ProtoFusionGirl.

## Scope
- Covers UL engine, resource loading, event handling, validation, UI, and modding hooks.

## Components
- UL Engine: Core logic, parsing, evaluation, and state management
- Resource Loader: Loads UL data from JSON, mods, or external sources
- Event System: Standardized events for puzzle lifecycle, validation, and context sync
- Validation: Context-aware, extensible validation pipeline
- UI: Puzzle modal, feedback, and accessibility
- Modding: Extension points for new puzzles, scripts, and resources

## Integration Points
- Game world scripting (via UniversalLanguageEngine)
- UI components (modal, panels)
- Modding API (src/mods/)
- Data-driven resource loading (assets/lang/ul/)

## Security & Safety
- All script evaluation must be sandboxed (no unsafe eval)
- Resource schemas must be validated before use
