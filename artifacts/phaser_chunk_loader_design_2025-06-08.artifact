# Phaser Chunk Loader Design

## Purpose
Enable performant rendering and memory management for large tilemaps and modded worlds by loading only visible map sections (chunks) in Phaser.

## Design Overview
- **Chunk Size:** Configurable (e.g., 10x10 tiles).
- **Dynamic Loading:** Load/unload chunks as the player moves.
- **Integration:** Works with mod loader to fetch tilemaps from IPFS/CDN.
- **Testing:** Include performance benchmarks for 1000x1000+ tilemaps.

## Implementation Steps
1. Define chunk data structure and loader interface in `src/core/`.
2. Update scene logic in `src/scenes/` to use chunk loader.
3. Integrate with mod loader for dynamic asset fetching.
4. Add unit/integration tests for chunk loading and unloading.

## Next Steps
- Prototype chunk loader in a test scene.
- Document performance results and update artifact.
