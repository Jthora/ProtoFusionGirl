# Retrospective: Tilemap System (2025-06-03)

## What Was Built
- Established initial design for tilemap and chunk management in `tilemap_system_design.artifact`.
- Created TODOs and feedback artifacts to guide and track development.
- Linked design artifacts to code for better traceability.

## What Changed
- Added artifact/code linkage conventions.
- Introduced directory snapshot and artifact index automation.

## Lessons Learned
- Keeping artifacts and code in sync is critical for effective AI/human collaboration.
- Directory snapshots and artifact indexing are valuable for onboarding and refactoring.

## Next Steps
- Implement or stub missing modules referenced in `TilemapManager.ts`.
- Begin core feature development for tilemap and chunk logic.
- Continue updating artifacts and running automation scripts after major changes.
