# Canonical Universal Language Spell Recipes (Copilot Migration)

## Purpose
Single, machine-readable source of truth for all spell recipes, symbol sequences, and requirements. Used for code/test generation and validation.

## Format (JSON Array)
```json
[
  {
    "id": "spell_001",
    "name": "Shield of Order",
    "symbol_sequence": ["line", "square", "circle"],
    "effect": "Creates a protective barrier.",
    "requirements": ["Order", "Fixed"],
    "related_symbols": ["line", "square", "circle"],
    "related_phonetics": ["laɪn", "skwɛər", "sɜːrkəl"],
    "glyphs": ["―", "□", "○"]
  }
  // ...more spells
]
```

## Update Instructions
- Update only via migration scripts or Copilot-driven refactor.
- All code, tests, and docs must reference this as the canonical spell recipe source.
