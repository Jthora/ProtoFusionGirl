# Copilot Memory Artifact

## Persistent Context
- Always keep artifact headers and cross-references up to date for discoverability.
- Use the artifact index and directory snapshot scripts after any major change.
- Reference artifacts in code for traceability and onboarding.

## Heuristics & Best Practices
- Prefer automation and scripts for repetitive or error-prone tasks.
- Use feedback/retrospective artifacts to drive continuous improvement.
- Keep onboarding steps in the primer actionable and current.
- Regularly check for unused or outdated artifacts and clean up as needed.

## Lessons Learned
- Artifact-driven development enables rapid AI/agent onboarding and context recall.
- Cross-linking artifacts and code accelerates both human and AI productivity.
- Versioning and snapshotting artifacts makes project history auditable and recoverable.

## Next Steps
- Expand this memory artifact as new heuristics, lessons, or context emerge.
- Reference this artifact in all future automation and onboarding scripts.
