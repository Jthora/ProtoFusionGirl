# Persona Core Design for ProtoFusionGirl

## Purpose
The Persona Core acts as a living operational lens for both AI (GitHub Copilot) and human contributors. It encodes project values, priorities, heuristics, and operational context, enabling context-aware, auditable, and adaptive decision-making.

## Key Principles
- **Layered Structure:**
  - Core Layer: Immutable project values and long-term goals.
  - Operational Layer: Current priorities, focus, and heuristics (updated as project evolves).
  - Contextual Layer: Real-time signals (onboarding gaps, blockers, urgent tasks) and recent history, possibly auto-updated by scripts or the self-prompt queue.
- **Transparency & Collaboration:**
  - Human-readable and editable.
  - Supports human overrides and annotations.
  - All changes are versioned and auditable.
- **Integration:**
  - Hooks for onboarding, self-prompting, and task selection scripts.
  - Used by Copilot to filter, sort, and select tasks, and to generate operational prompts.
- **Self-Improvement:**
  - Includes meta-prompts for Copilot to self-reflect and prompt for human review if misalignment is detected.
  - Feedback loop for both AI and humans to propose updates.
- **Balance:**
  - Provides strong guidance but allows for justified deviations and human intervention.

## Example Structure
```json
{
  "coreValues": ["AI-first automation", "Artifact-driven development", "Rapid onboarding", "Human-AI collaboration"],
  "operationalFocus": {
    "currentPriority": "Universal Magic Puzzle Integration for Warp Anchors",
    "secondaryFocus": ["Onboarding hygiene", "Task automation"]
  },
  "decisionHeuristics": [
    "Resolve blockers and errors first",
    "Prioritize tasks with highest impact and lowest effort",
    "Keep documentation and onboarding up to date",
    "Favor automation and self-maintaining workflows"
  ],
  "overrides": {
    "2025-06-04": "Pause all new features until onboarding gaps are resolved"
  },
  "metaPrompts": [
    "Is my current focus still aligned with project goals?",
    "Should I prompt for human review before reprioritizing?"
  ],
  "integrationHooks": {
    "onboarding": "Reference Persona Core for initial focus",
    "taskSelection": "Filter and sort tasks using decisionHeuristics",
    "selfPrompting": "Generate new prompts based on operationalFocus"
  },
  "version": "2025-06-04T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Best Practices
- Keep the Persona Core up to date with project evolution.
- Use it as the single source of truth for AI/human operational context.
- Integrate with onboarding, task management, and self-prompting systems.
- Regularly review and version changes for transparency and improvement.
- Encourage both AI and human contributors to propose updates as priorities shift.
