# ProtoFusionGirl: Multiverse Systems Priority TODO List (2025-06-05)

## 1. Core Save/Load, Timeline, and Branching System
- [x] Implement in-memory multiverse state, branch/anchor/delta management, and APIs.
- [x] Integrate with tile editing and world state changes.
- [x] Finalize migration helpers and legacy data support.
- [ ] Document all APIs and edge cases for downstream systems.

## 2. UI Integration & Visualization
- [x] Update anchor/warp UI (`WarpAnchorPanel.ts`) to use new branch/anchor APIs.
- [x] Update timeline UI (`TimelinePanel.ts`) for real-time branch/anchor/delta visualization.
- [x] Implement multiverse explorer and diff/merge UI (per `copilot_world_state_tooling`).
- [x] Add repair/migration wizards for save data.

## 3. Event Engine & Narrative State
- [x] Integrate event/quest state tracking with new persistence model.
- [x] Implement event/quest propagation and merge logic across branches.
- [x] Add hooks for narrative triggers and world changes.
- [x] Test edge cases: conflicting events, quest fail/success in different branches.

## 4. Procedural Content Registry & Modding
- [x] Integrate registry lookups for seeds, datakeys, and procedural rules in save/load and editing flows.
- [x] Implement versioning, migration, and mod validation APIs.
- [x] Add mod/content registration and deprecation support.

## 5. Multiverse Sync, Sharing, and Collaboration
- [x] Implement anchor/branch export/import, diff/merge, and conflict resolution.
- [x] Add real-time sync hooks for multiplayer and community events.
- [x] Define and enforce permissions and access control for sharing/editing.

## 6. Cosmic/Environmental Simulation
- [x] Integrate simulation state (ley lines, vortices, cosmic events) with branch/timeline persistence.
- [x] Add event hooks for narrative/gameplay triggers.
- [x] Test simulation rollback, replay, and branch merges.

## 7. Universal Language & Puzzle Scripting
- [x] Integrate scripting engine with save/load and branch/anchor systems.
- [x] Implement sandboxing, error handling, and debugging for scripts.
- [x] Add narrative/gameplay triggers and extensibility for new puzzle types.

## 8. Analytics, Replay, and Emergent Storytelling
- [x] Implement analytics/replay tracking per branch/timeline.
- [x] Add export/import of stories and world states.
- [x] Integrate analytics hooks for live events and community challenges.
- [x] Provide opt-in/opt-out and privacy controls for analytics.

## 9. Automated Testing & Validation
- [x] Expand automated tests for all new flows: delta recording, branch/anchor management, UI, migration, event propagation, simulation, and analytics.
- [x] Test edge cases and performance for large/complex multiverse states.

## 10. Documentation & Onboarding
- [x] Update all relevant documentation and onboarding guides to reflect new systems and workflows.
- [x] Ensure `.manifest`, `.primer`, and onboarding scripts are current.
