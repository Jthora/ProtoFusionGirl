# Chunk Replacement System: Modding & Extensibility

## Mod Hooks
- Allow mods to hook into chunk replacement events.
- Provide a callback: `onChunkReplaced(chunkX, chunkY, newChunk, oldChunk)`.
- Document how mods can update or veto chunk replacement.

## Extensibility
- Support for custom chunk data (e.g., puzzle state, magic fields).
- Allow mods to register additional update handlers for minimap, UI, etc.
