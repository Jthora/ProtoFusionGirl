# Chunk Replacement System: Requirements and Design

## Purpose
Define the requirements and design for a robust chunk replacement system to support reality warping and warp zones.

## Requirements
- Replace existing world chunks with newly generated ones after a warp (partial or full).
- Ensure seamless integration with ChunkManager and TilemapManager.
- Update all in-memory and rendered data (tilemaps, physics, entities, minimap).
- Support both local (partial) and global (full) world regeneration.
- Minimize performance impact and avoid visual glitches.
- Provide hooks for mods and future puzzle/magic systems.

## Design
- Expose a method in ChunkManager: `replaceChunk(chunkX, chunkY, newChunk)`.
- After chunk regeneration, call this method to update the loaded chunks map.
- Trigger downstream updates (tilemap, minimap, physics, etc.) after replacement.
- Document edge cases (e.g., player inside replaced chunk, entity migration).
