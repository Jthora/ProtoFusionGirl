# Anchor Management UI/UX Improvements

## Summary
This artifact documents the implementation and rationale for anchor editing (rename, delete) and minimap integration in the ProtoFusionGirl reality warping system.

## Features Implemented
- Anchor panel now supports renaming and deleting anchors via intuitive UI buttons.
- All anchor changes (add, edit, delete) are immediately reflected on the minimap overlay.
- Anchor creation, editing, and deletion update both the UI and minimap for consistent feedback.
- UI/UX design prioritizes accessibility and clarity, with staged rollout for advanced features.

## Rationale
- Improves usability and player agency in managing reality anchors.
- Lays groundwork for multiplayer anchor sharing, timeline navigation, and advanced visualization.
- Addresses UI/UX burden by making anchor management more intuitive and accessible.

## Next Steps
- Add anchor persistence (save/load across sessions).
- Integrate anchor sharing and multiplayer sync.
- Continue staged rollout of advanced anchor/timeline features.
