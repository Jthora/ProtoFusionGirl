# Chunk Replacement System: Edge Cases & Testing

## Edge Cases
- Player or entities inside a chunk being replaced.
- Chunks with unsaved edits or modded data.
- Multiplayer: sync chunk replacement across clients.
- Minimap and UI not updating after chunk change.
- Physics bodies not refreshed after tilemap update.

## Testing Plan
- Unit test: Replace a chunk and verify new data is present.
- Integration test: Trigger a warp and check world, minimap, and UI update.
- Manual test: Warp while standing on a chunk boundary.
- Regression test: Ensure no memory leaks or stale references.
