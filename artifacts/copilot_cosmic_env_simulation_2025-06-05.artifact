# Cosmic/Environmental Simulation Layer

## Purpose
Simulate ley lines, vortices, cosmic events, and environmental hazards that persist and interact with timeline/branch changes. Provide hooks for narrative and gameplay integration.

## Key Features
- Persistent simulation of ley lines, time vortices, and environmental states.
- Event hooks for narrative and gameplay triggers.
- Integration with save/load, event engine, and world state systems.

## Data Model
- Per-branch environmental state and cosmic event logs.
- Ley line and vortex metadata.

## Prototype Plan
1. Define simulation schema for ley lines, vortices, and events.
2. Implement persistent simulation logic.
3. Add event hooks for narrative/gameplay.
4. Integrate with save/load and event engine.
5. Test with sample cosmic events and timeline changes.

## Simulation Complexity & Performance
- Discuss tradeoffs for simulation fidelity vs. performance (e.g., tick rate, region-of-interest).
- Support for pausing, fast-forwarding, or backgrounding simulation.

## Integration Points
- Define hooks for event engine, procedural registry, and narrative triggers.
- Ensure simulation state is branch/timeline aware and persists across merges/splits.

## Expanded Testing Plan
- Test cosmic events during timeline splits/merges.
- Test simulation rollback and replay.
- Test integration with event/narrative engine.
