# Universal Language & Puzzle Scripting Engine

## Purpose
Enable in-world programming of reality, puzzle solutions, and advanced editing using the Universal Language mechanic. Integrate puzzle logic and scripting with world state and save/load systems.

## Key Features
- Scripting engine for Universal Language expressions.
- Puzzle and event hooks for narrative/gameplay.
- Integration with tile/datakey/seed and save/load systems.

## Data Model
- Scripted puzzle/logic state per branch/anchor.
- Universal Language expression logs and results.

## Language Syntax & Error Handling
- Define core syntax and extensibility for the Universal Language.
- Provide error handling, debugging, and feedback for script authors.

## Security & Sandboxing
- Sandbox all in-world scripting to prevent exploits or crashes.
- Validate and limit resource usage for user scripts.

## Prototype Plan
1. Define scripting language and puzzle schema.
2. Implement scripting engine and puzzle hooks.
3. Integrate with save/load and tile/datakey systems.
4. Add narrative/gameplay triggers.
5. Test with sample puzzles and world edits.

## Expanded Testing Plan
- Test puzzle complexity, failure modes, and script errors.
- Test extensibility for new puzzle types and narrative triggers.
