# ProtoFusionGirl: Refactor Anchor Artifacts

This artifact anchors the critical refactor of the world, ley line, and event systems. It lists the essential artifacts, their roles, and navigation tips for onboarding, deduplication, and architectural clarity.

## Essential Artifacts for Refactor (with Summaries)

- **ONBOARDING.md**: Entry point for onboarding, directory structure, and agent/human quick start. _How to get started and where to look._
- **.primer**: Project philosophy, conventions, and best practices. _Why we do things this way._
- **.manifest**: Machine-readable index of all key files, artifacts, and scripts. _Find any file or artifact instantly._
- **.priming**: Agent-specific context and rules. _How agents should behave and automate._
- **artifacts/architecture_blueprint_2025-06-07.artifact**: Latest architectural blueprint and integration map. _System structure, boundaries, and integration points. See also: `artifact_graph.dot` for a visual map._
- **artifacts/copilot_leyline_unification_plan_2025-06-06.artifact**: Step-by-step ley line/world/event system unification plan. _Migration and deduplication checklist._
- **artifacts/upgrade_roadmap_2025-06-05.artifact**: Prioritized upgrade plan and dependencies. _What to do next and in what order._
- **.dashboard**: Project status, open tasks, and blockers. _Live status and what needs attention._
- **Test files**: For validation after each refactor step. _See `test/`, `src/**/__tests__`, and use VS Code tasks: `Run All Tests` or `Run Single Jest Test`._
- **docs/docs_index_L1.json & docs_index_L2.json**: Documentation lookup and navigation. _Fast doc search and deep context._
