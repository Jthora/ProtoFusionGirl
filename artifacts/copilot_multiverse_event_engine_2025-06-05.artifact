# Multiverse Event & Narrative State Engine

## Purpose
Track and propagate quests, events, and narrative states across all branches/timelines. Enable story/world changes to ripple through the multiverse, supporting branch merges, collapses, and narrative logic.

## Key Features
- Branch-aware quest and event tracking (per timeline/branch).
- Propagation and resolution of world/narrative changes across branches.
- Support for anchor/collapse/merge events and their narrative consequences.
- Timeline-aware triggers for story beats, puzzles, and world changes.
- Integration with save/load and anchor systems.

## Data Model
- Per-branch event and quest state.
- Parent/child branch relationships and divergence points.
- Event propagation rules (e.g., what ripples, what is local).

## Event Propagation & Edge Cases
- Define rules for how events/quests propagate across branches (e.g., local vs. global events).
- Handle conflicting events: specify resolution order or require user/developer intervention.
- Support for event/quest localization and complex dependencies (e.g., fail states, prerequisites).

## Prototype Plan
1. Define event/quest state schema (branch-aware).
2. Implement event propagation and merge logic.
3. Integrate with save/load and anchor/branch UI.
4. Add hooks for narrative triggers and world changes.
5. Test with sample quests, events, and branch merges.

## Expanded Testing Plan
- Test propagation and merge of conflicting events/quests.
- Test narrative edge cases (e.g., quest fail in one branch, success in another).
- Test localization and branching quest logic.
