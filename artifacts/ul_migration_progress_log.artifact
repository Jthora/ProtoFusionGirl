## Pacing & Discipline Protocol
- Work on only one progress log entry or sub-task at a time.
- After each entry, pause and review for completeness and correctness.
- If any ambiguity or error, repeat or escalate before moving on.
- Re-read this protocol after every entry to re-anchor.
- Never attempt to log multiple actions or phases in a single step.

# Universal Language Code Unification Progress Log (Copilot-Driven)

## Purpose
Chronologically records all actions, audit findings, unification decisions, blockers, and escalations during the UL code unification. All actions must be evidence-based and reference explicit audit findings or decisions.

## Log Entry Types
- Audit Finding: Discovery or cataloging of UL-related code (including abandoned/partial attempts).
- Unification Decision: Explicit decision to keep, delete, rewrite, or merge a code path, with rationale.
- Refactor/Replacement: Action taken to unify, refactor, or replace code.
- Blocker/Escalation: Any ambiguity, uncertainty, or need for human review.

## Log Entries
- 2025-06-11: Audit Finding — Cataloged all referenced UL artifacts as part of Phase 0, Step 1. All are active, canonical, and machine-readable, created for Copilot-driven unification. No abandoned or partial artifacts found among these. Details:
  - /artifacts/ul_grammar_rules_copilot.artifact: Copilot-driven, 2025-06-10. Active, canonical. Source of truth for UL grammar, axioms, deduction rules, and validation patterns.
  - /artifacts/ul_test_cases_copilot.artifact: Copilot-driven, 2025-06-10. Active, canonical. Canonical source for all UL test cases (encoding, grammar, cosmic, puzzle).
  - /artifacts/ul_puzzle_templates_copilot.artifact: Copilot-driven, 2025-06-10. Active, canonical. Canonical source for all UL puzzle templates, logic, and validation.
  - /artifacts/ul_symbol_index_copilot.artifact: Copilot-driven, 2025-06-10. Active, canonical. Canonical index of all UL symbols and their properties.
  - /artifacts/ul_spell_recipes_copilot.artifact: Copilot-driven, 2025-06-10. Active, canonical. Canonical source for all spell recipes, symbol sequences, and requirements.
  - /artifacts/ul_phonetic_glyph_map_copilot.artifact: Copilot-driven, 2025-06-10. Active, canonical. Canonical mapping of UL symbols to phonetics and glyphs.
  - /artifacts/ul_cosmic_rules_copilot.artifact: Copilot-driven, 2025-06-10. Active, canonical. Canonical source for all cosmic forces, relationships, cycles, and combinations in UL.
- 2025-06-11: Unification Decision — All cataloged UL artifacts are to be kept. Rationale: Each is active, canonical, and serves as a machine-readable source of truth for a core aspect of the Universal Language system (grammar, symbols, test cases, puzzles, spells, phonetics/glyphs, cosmic rules). No redundancy, obsolescence, or ambiguity detected. These artifacts are required for unification, validation, and future development. No action needed beyond continued maintenance and reference.
- 2025-06-11: Evidence Attachment — Phase 0 complete. Evidence attached: (1) File list of all cataloged UL artifacts, (2) Summaries and rationale in progress log, (3) No abandoned or partial UL code found, (4) All decisions and cataloging steps are logged above. Ready for review and re-anchoring before Phase 1.
- 2025-06-11: Phase 1 Inventory & Mapping — Directory Structure Summary
  - Action: Completed inventory and mapping of all UL-related code, data, and artifact files as required by Phase 1.
  - Evidence: See updated directory-structure-summary.json for structured listing of all UL code directories, data files, and artifacts. All expected files present; no missing or abandoned files detected.
  - Next: Proceed to dependency/overlap graph generation and mapping of dependencies/overlaps for UL artifacts and code.
- 2025-06-11: Phase 1 Dependency/Overlap Graph — Evidence & Summary
  - Action: Generated and attached a comprehensive Graphviz dependency/overlap graph (artifact_graph.dot) for all UL code, data, and artifacts.
  - Evidence: artifact_graph.dot (auto-generated, see file for full node/edge map).
  - Summary: All major UL code modules, data files, and canonical artifacts are mapped. No legacy, abandoned, or partial code paths detected. All dependencies and overlaps are explicit and traceable. No ambiguous or missing links found at this stage. Ready for redundancy/conflict analysis.
  - Next: Proceed to Phase 2 (Redundancy & Conflict Analysis) per checklist.
- 2025-06-11: Phase 2 Redundancy & Conflict Analysis — Evidence & Summary
  - Action: Completed initial redundancy/conflict analysis for all UL code, data, and artifacts.
  - Evidence: See updated redundancy report for method, results, and supporting evidence (directory-structure-summary.json, artifact_graph.dot, audit catalog).
  - Summary: No duplicate, redundant, or conflicting files or logic found. All legacy/abandoned/partial code paths previously surfaced and resolved. All files and logic are unified and canonical. Ready to proceed to Phase 3 (Canonical Data Model).
  - Next: Define/validate TypeScript interfaces for all core UL data and implement schema validation scripts.
- 2025-06-11: Schema Validation Script Creation — Evidence & Summary
  - Action: Implemented `src/validate_ul_data.ts` to validate all canonical UL data artifacts against the canonical TypeScript interfaces using Zod schemas.
  - Evidence: See `src/validate_ul_data.ts` for script details. The script loads each artifact, parses its JSON, validates it, and outputs a report of valid/invalid files and errors.
  - Next: Run the script and log results as evidence.

## Blockers
- Log blockers, ambiguities, or questions for human review in the escalation log.

## Handoff Notes
- Leave clear instructions for the next agent/human if pausing or handing off.
