# Multiverse Synchronization & Sharing Layer

## Purpose
Enable anchor sharing, collaborative editing, and reality sync for multiplayer and community events. Support branch diffing, merging, and real-time sync.

## Key Features
- Anchor export/import and validation (datakey/seed aware).
- Branch diff/merge and conflict resolution (CRDT-ready).
- Real-time sync for co-op or competitive play.
- Integration with save/load, anchor, and branch systems.

## Data Model
- Exportable/importable anchor and branch data.
- Branch diff/merge metadata and conflict logs.

## Prototype Plan
1. Define anchor/branch export/import formats.
2. Implement diff/merge and conflict resolution logic.
3. Add real-time sync hooks for multiplayer.
4. Integrate with save/load and UI.
5. Test with anchor sharing and branch merges.

## Real-Time Sync & Failure Handling
- Outline strategies for real-time sync: optimistic updates, rollback, and partial failure recovery.
- Support for offline/online transitions and sync conflict resolution.

## Permissions & Access Control
- Define user roles and permissions for anchor/branch sharing and editing.
- Support for private, shared, and public branches/anchors.

## User Flow Examples
- Example: Player A exports an anchor, Player B imports and merges it into their timeline.
- Example: Two players collaboratively edit a branch and resolve a merge conflict.
