# Artifact Testing & Validation Strategy

## Purpose
Ensure every schema, contract, and automation artifact includes test cases and validation scripts that Copilot/AI can run and update.

## Strategy
- **Schemas:**
  - For each JSON schema, provide example data and Jest test cases.
  - Automate validation in mod submission and onboarding scripts.
- **Contracts:**
  - For each smart contract, include unit tests (e.g., Hardhat/Foundry) and security checklists.
  - Require human review for governance/security artifacts.
- **Automation Scripts:**
  - Add self-tests and output validation for all scripts.
- **Reporting:**
  - Output test/validation results to `artifacts/` for traceability.

## Next Steps
- Audit existing artifacts for missing tests/validation.
- Add/expand test cases and validation scripts as needed.
