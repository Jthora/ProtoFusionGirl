# Timestream Framework: Narrative & Consequence Tracking

## Narrative Integration
- Log all anchor uses and resulting consequences (NPC reactions, world events, quest changes).
- Track branch-specific narrative state (quests, factions, puzzles).
- Provide APIs for querying and replaying consequences per branch.
- UI/UX: Visualize consequences and branch history for the player.

## Technical Notes
- Use event logs and consequence trees per branch.
- Allow mods to register custom consequence handlers.
