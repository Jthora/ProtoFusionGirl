## Purpose
Defines the canonical, extensible list of possible outcomes for combat missions in ProtoFusionGirl. Supports narrative depth, replayability, and meaningful player choice.

## Outcome Types
- victory_by_defeat: All enemies defeated (classic win)
- defeat_by_death: Player or party is killed (classic loss)
- retreat_escape: Player escapes or flees the battle
- surrender: Player or enemy surrenders, leading to negotiation or capture
- capture_rescue: Player captures an enemy or rescues an ally/hostage
- stalemate: Neither side wins; mission ends in a draw or unresolved state
- diplomatic_resolution: Combat is avoided or ended via negotiation, intimidation, or persuasion
- objective_accomplished: Player completes a non-combat objective during the fight (e.g., hacking, sabotage, stealing, protecting)
- environmental_outcome: The environment changes the outcome (e.g., collapse, fire, flooding, time runs out)
- transformation: Player or enemy is transformed (e.g., mind control, corruption, conversion)
- betrayal_ally_switch: An ally or enemy switches sides mid-combat
- special_condition: Custom outcomes (e.g., puzzle solved, artifact activated, ritual completed)
- mercy_spare: Player chooses to spare an enemy, leading to future consequences
- recruitment: Player recruits an enemy or NPC during/after combat
- resource_depletion: Player runs out of key resources (ammo, energy, time), forcing a different outcome
