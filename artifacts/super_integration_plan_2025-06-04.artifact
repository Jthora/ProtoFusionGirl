# ProtoFusionGirl Super Integration Plan
Author: GitHub Copilot
Date: 2025-06-04

## Purpose
This artifact provides a comprehensive, actionable plan for integrating all core systems (persona core, combat, missions, reality warping, multiplayer, modding, automation, and universal symbology) into the existing ProtoFusionGirl codebase. It also outlines strategies for cross-system integration, artifact/code synchronization, and continuous improvement.

---

## 1. Integration Roadmap
- **Phase 1: Foundation**
  - Refactor codebase to ensure modularity and clear API boundaries for each core system.
  - Implement or update data schemas as defined in artifacts (persona, combat, missions, etc.).
  - Establish a shared event bus or messaging system for inter-system communication.

- **Phase 2: Core System Implementation**
  - Build or refactor persona core module as the central player state manager.
  - Integrate combat mechanics, referencing persona stats/abilities and supporting modding hooks.
  - Implement mission system with data-driven definitions, branching logic, and integration with persona and combat.
  - Add reality warping as a sandboxed, extensible module with rollback and validation.

- **Phase 3: Cross-System Features**
  - Ensure missions can trigger combat, reality warping, and multiplayer events.
  - Enable combat and reality warping to update mission and persona state.
  - Integrate universal symbology system into missions, puzzles, and crafting.
  - Add multiplayer/anchor sharing with real-time sync and security.

- **Phase 4: Modding & Automation**
  - Expose APIs and data formats for modding all major systems.
  - Integrate automation scripts for onboarding, docs indexing, and AI-driven development loops.
  - Ensure all artifacts are referenced in code and vice versa (bi-directional traceability).

- **Phase 5: Continuous Improvement**
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines to validate artifact/code alignment.
  - Auto-generate feedback artifacts for missing/weak docs or integration issues.
  - Regularly review and update the artifact index and cross-links.

## 2. Cross-Integration Strategies
- **Event-Driven Architecture:**
  - Use a central event bus for all major systems to publish/subscribe to game events (e.g., mission started, combat resolved, reality warped).
- **Shared Data Schemas:**
  - Define and enforce shared schemas (YAML/JSON) for player state, missions, combat, etc., as single sources of truth.
- **Artifact-Driven Code Generation:**
  - Use scripts to generate code stubs, validation logic, and documentation from artifacts.
- **Automated Testing:**
  - Write integration tests that simulate cross-system scenarios (e.g., mission triggers combat, reality warping affects mission outcome).
- **Modding Hooks:**
  - Ensure all systems expose hooks/events for modding and automation.
- **Documentation Sync:**
  - Automate the update of docs index and ensure all code changes are reflected in artifacts and vice versa.

---

## 3. Artifact/Code Synchronization
- **Bi-Directional Links:**
  - Every artifact should reference relevant code modules/files; code should reference artifacts in comments/docstrings.
- **Artifact Indexing:**
  - Maintain and auto-update `artifact_index.artifact` with all new/updated artifacts.
- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Scripts auto-generate feedback artifacts for any detected misalignment or missing integration.

## 4. Implementation Milestones
- [ ] Refactor codebase for modularity and event-driven design
- [ ] Implement persona core as central state manager
- [ ] Integrate combat, missions, and reality warping with shared schemas and event bus
- [ ] Add multiplayer and anchor sharing
- [ ] Expose modding APIs and automation scripts
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for artifact/code validation
- [ ] Regularly review and update all artifacts and cross-links

---

## 5. Continuous Improvement & Governance
- **Weekly artifact/code review meetings**
- **Automated artifact/code sync scripts**
- **Community feedback via modding and docs contributions**
- **Ongoing onboarding and documentation improvements**
