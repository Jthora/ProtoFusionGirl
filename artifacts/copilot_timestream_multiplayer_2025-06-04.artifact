# Timestream Framework: Multiplayer & Conflict Resolution

## Multiplayer Challenges
- Simultaneous anchor use/branching by multiple players.
- Syncing timestream state and anchor logs across clients.
- Conflict resolution: merging, forking, or vetoing branches.
- Authority: who decides the canonical timestream in multiplayer?

## Technical Directions
- Use CRDTs or event sourcing for distributed branch/event logs.
- Provide APIs for branch negotiation, merge, and rollback.
- Log all anchor/timestream changes for replay and audit.
