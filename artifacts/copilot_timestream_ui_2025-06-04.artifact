# Timestream Framework: UI/UX & Visualization

## UI/UX Goals
- Timeline explorer: visualize branches, anchor events, and consequences.
- Branch selector: allow players to navigate, compare, and restore branches.
- Anchor history: show all anchor uses and their effects.
- Accessibility: support for colorblind, keyboard, and screen reader users.

## Technical Directions
- Use graph visualization libraries for timeline UI.
- Provide APIs for UI to query and subscribe to timestream changes.
- Modularize UI for easy extension and modding.
