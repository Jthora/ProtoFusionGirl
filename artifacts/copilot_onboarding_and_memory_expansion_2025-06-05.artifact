# Copilot Onboarding & Memory Expansion Guide (2025-06-05)

## When to Update Onboarding/Memory Artifacts
- After implementing a new system or major feature
- When refactoring or reorganizing code structure
- When adding new onboarding scripts or context anchors
- After resolving major blockers or feedback items

## Steps for Expanding Onboarding/Memory
1. Update `.primer`, `.manifest`, and `.priming` with new context or rules.
2. Add new system/module to `copilot_context_anchor_index_2025-06-05.artifact`.
3. Update `copilot_feature_matrix_2025-06-05.artifact` and `copilot_missing_systems_checklist_2025-06-05.artifact`.
4. Add lessons learned, heuristics, or persistent context to `copilot_memory.artifact`.
5. Rerun onboarding and context sync scripts to ensure all agents are up to date.

## Best Practices
- Cross-link new artifacts and code modules for discoverability
- Use feedback artifacts to log blockers and lessons
- Keep onboarding steps actionable and current
- Regularly review and clean up outdated context
