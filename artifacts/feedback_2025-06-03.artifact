# Feedback Log (2025-06-03)

## Blockers
- Some imports in `TilemapManager.ts` are missing or unresolved (e.g., `WorldEditService`, `TileRegistry`, `WorldPersistence`). Need to implement or stub these modules, or update the artifact/code to reflect current state.

## Insights
- Referencing artifacts in code comments is helpful for context, but only if artifacts are kept up to date.
- Directory snapshots are useful for planning refactors and onboarding.

## Workflow Improvements
- Consider a script to check for missing artifact references in code and prompt to create/update them.
- Automate artifact and directory snapshot updates after major merges or releases.
