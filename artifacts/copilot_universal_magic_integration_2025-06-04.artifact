# Universal Magic Integration Plan (2025-06-04)

## Goals
- Make all reality warping, anchor, and timeline manipulation actions part of the Universal Magic system
- Require Universal Language puzzles or crafting for advanced anchor use
- Provide lore-driven tutorials and discovery for Universal Magic
- Allow for secrets and emergent play (hidden anchor types, advanced rituals)

## Implementation
- Add Universal Language puzzle/crafting UI to anchor creation/restoration
- Link anchor use to Timestream Framework (timeline scrubbing, branching)
- Add narrative and gameplay consequences for misuse/overuse
- Expose APIs for mods to add new Universal Magic effects and anchor types
