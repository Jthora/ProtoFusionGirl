# Test System Audit (Initial)

## Date:
2025-06-08

## Scope
- All test files in `src/` and `test/` directories
- Unit, integration, and scenario tests

## Coverage Summary
- 39 test suites run: 15 passed, 24 failed
- Many failures are due to TypeScript type errors, missing exports, argument mismatches, and test data issues
- Some tests are missing or incomplete (e.g., test/customization/Cosmetics.test.ts)
- Critical path systems (leyline, world, tilemap, event, modding, narrative) have failing or incomplete tests

## Gaps Identified
- Type errors and API mismatches between tests and implementation
- Incomplete or missing test data/fixtures
- Outdated or missing exports in modules (e.g., LeyLine)
- Some tests reference non-existent or private properties
- Some integration tests are not aligned with current codebase

## Action Items
- [ ] Fix TypeScript type errors and update test imports/exports
- [ ] Update or add missing test data and fixtures
- [ ] Align integration tests with current APIs and module structure
- [ ] Ensure all test suites contain at least one valid test
- [ ] Re-run audit after fixes and document progress
