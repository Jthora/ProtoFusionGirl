# Timestream Framework: Deep Technical Design

## Purpose
Enable robust, scalable, and extensible timeline branching, anchor event logging, and narrative consequence management for reality warping (warp zones/anchors).

## Key Technical Questions
- How to efficiently store, prune, and traverse a potentially massive timeline DAG/tree?
- How to serialize and restore world state deterministically for each branch?
- How to handle multiplayer conflicts and branch merges?
- How to track and replay narrative consequences and side effects?
- How to modularize for modding, UI, and future expansion?

## Design Directions
- Use a DAG structure for branches, with unique branch/event IDs (hashes).
- Store only diffs or changed chunks per branch for efficiency.
- Anchor events log metadata, world state hash, and consequences.
- Provide hooks for mods and narrative systems.
- UI/UX: Timeline explorer, branch selector, anchor history.
