# ProtoFusionGirl: Master Multiverse Systems Plan

This master artifact outlines the essential technical systems and their sub-artifacts required to fully realize the game's vision of a persistent, branching, reality-warping multiverse. Each section references a sub-artifact with detailed design and implementation plans.

## 1. Save/Load, Timeline, and Branching System
- **Artifact:** `save_system_design_2025-06-05.artifact`
- **Purpose:** Core seed/delta/timeline-aware persistence, branch/anchor management, and multiverse navigation.

## 2. Multiverse Event & Narrative State Engine
- **Artifact:** `copilot_multiverse_event_engine_2025-06-05.artifact`
- **Purpose:** Branch-aware quest, event, and narrative state tracking; propagation and resolution of story/world changes across timelines.

## 3. Procedural Content Registry & Modding API
- **Artifact:** `copilot_procedural_content_registry_2025-06-05.artifact`
- **Purpose:** Versioned registry of seeds, datakeys, procedural rules, and modded content; migration and modding support.

## 4. Multiverse Synchronization & Sharing Layer
- **Artifact:** `copilot_multiverse_sync_sharing_2025-06-05.artifact`
- **Purpose:** Anchor sharing, collaborative editing, branch diff/merge, and real-time sync for multiplayer/community events.

## 5. World State Diffing, Visualization, and Debugging Tools
- **Artifact:** `copilot_world_state_tooling_2025-06-05.artifact`
- **Purpose:** Visual multiverse explorer, world state diff/merge UI, save data repair and migration tools.

## 6. Cosmic/Environmental Simulation Layer
- **Artifact:** `copilot_cosmic_env_simulation_2025-06-05.artifact`
- **Purpose:** Persistent simulation of ley lines, vortices, cosmic events, and environmental hazards; hooks for narrative and gameplay.

## 7. Universal Language & Puzzle Scripting Engine
- **Artifact:** `copilot_universal_language_engine_2025-06-05.artifact`
- **Purpose:** Scripting engine for Universal Language expressions, puzzle logic, and in-world programming of reality.

## 8. Analytics, Replay, and Emergent Storytelling Support
- **Artifact:** `copilot_analytics_replay_story_2025-06-05.artifact`
- **Purpose:** Timeline/branch analytics, replay system, export/import of emergent stories, and hooks for live events.

## System Dependencies & Priorities
- The following is a suggested build order and dependency map:
  1. Save/Load, Timeline, and Branching System (foundation for all others)
  2. Procedural Content Registry & Modding API (needed for content integrity)
  3. Multiverse Event & Narrative State Engine (relies on save/load and content registry)
  4. Cosmic/Environmental Simulation Layer (relies on event engine and save/load)
  5. Universal Language & Puzzle Scripting Engine (relies on save/load, content registry)
  6. Multiverse Synchronization & Sharing Layer (relies on save/load, event engine)
  7. World State Diffing, Visualization, and Debugging Tools (relies on all above)
  8. Analytics, Replay, and Emergent Storytelling Support (relies on all above)

## Notes
- Ownership/workflow for artifact updates should be assigned as the team grows.
- A visual diagram of system relationships is recommended for onboarding and planning.

## Next Steps
- For each sub-artifact, create a detailed design and prototype plan, referencing this master artifact.
- Ensure all systems are branch/timeline/anchor aware and deeply integrated with the core save/load architecture.
- Use this artifact as the canonical index for all multiverse systems work.
