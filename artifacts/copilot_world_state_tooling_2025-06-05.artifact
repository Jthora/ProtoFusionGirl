# World State Diffing, Visualization, and Debugging Tools

## Purpose
Allow developers and advanced players to inspect, compare, and repair world states, branches, and deltas. Support migration, debugging, and community-driven content.

## Key Features
- Visual multiverse tree/graph explorer.
- World state diff/merge UI.
- Save data repair and migration wizards.
- Integration with save/load and branch/anchor systems.

## Data Model
- Branch/anchor/delta metadata for visualization.
- Diff/merge logs and repair history.

## Prototype Plan
1. Design UI/UX for multiverse explorer and diff/merge tools.
2. Implement world state diffing and visualization logic.
3. Add repair/migration helpers.
4. Integrate with save/load and anchor/branch UI.
5. Test with sample save data and branch merges.

## Performance & Scalability
- Design for large save files and many branches/anchors (e.g., lazy loading, chunked diffs).
- Optimize visualization for complex multiverse graphs.

## UI/UX Design
- Include wireframes or sketches for the multiverse explorer and diff/merge UI.
- Support for both developer and advanced player workflows.

## Automated vs. Manual Repair
- Provide both automated repair tools (e.g., fix common issues) and manual editing for advanced users.
- Track repair/migration history for auditability.
