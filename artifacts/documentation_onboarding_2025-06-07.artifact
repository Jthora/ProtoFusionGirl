# Documentation & Onboarding Artifact

## Purpose
Standardize documentation and onboarding for contributors and AI agents.

## Folder-level README.md Templates
- Each major folder/domain must have a README.md explaining:
  - Purpose
  - Main modules/classes
  - Integration points
  - Example usage

## Barrel File (`index.ts`) Conventions
- Each folder exports its public API via `index.ts`
- Example: `export * from './Jane'; export * from './SkillTree';`

## Onboarding Checklist
- Read ONBOARDING.md and relevant README.md files
- Run onboarding scripts/tasks
- Review architecture and event contract artifacts
- Run and pass all tests

## Example Documentation
- Provide a sample README.md for a domain (e.g., Characters)
