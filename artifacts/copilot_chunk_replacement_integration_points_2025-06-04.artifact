# Chunk Replacement System: Integration Points

## Where to Integrate
- `WorldGen.regenerateWorldFromSeed`: After generating a new chunk, call `ChunkManager.replaceChunk`.
- `RealityWarpSystem`: Ensure chunk replacement is triggered after a warp.
- `TilemapManager`: Provide a method to refresh tilemaps and entities after chunk replacement.
- `GameScene`: Listen for warp events and trigger UI/physics/minimap updates.

## Notes
- Ensure all references to old chunk data are updated.
- Consider batching updates for performance during large/full warps.
