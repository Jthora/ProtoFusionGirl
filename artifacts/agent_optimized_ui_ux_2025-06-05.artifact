# Agent-Optimized UI/UX

## Principles
- Modular, context-aware overlays and panels for both ASI (player) and Jane (avatar).
- Clear distinction between ASI (player) and Jane (avatar) actions and feedback.
- Immediate and delayed feedback for player choices, including narrative, emotional, and world state consequences.

## UI Components
- Mission planning, resource management, Universal Magic input, timeline navigation, community/faction interaction.
- Feedback overlays for narrative, world state, and emotional/relationship changes (distinct for ASI and Jane).
- Context-sensitive notifications and prompts for both ASI and Jane perspectives.

## Modding Support
- UI components are pluggable and extensible, supporting new overlays, feedback types, and dual-role extensions.
