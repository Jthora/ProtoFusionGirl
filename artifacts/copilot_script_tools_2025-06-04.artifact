# Artifact: copilot_script_generator_2025-06-04.artifact

## Title
Script Generator for Missions, World Events, and Threats

## Purpose
Automate the creation of boilerplate code and artifact files for new missions, world events, and dynamic threats. Streamlines the process for designers and developers to add new content.

## Description
- Prompts user for type (mission, event, threat), name, and key parameters (via CLI or config file).
- Generates TypeScript/JSON/YAML stubs in the appropriate directories (e.g., `src/world/missions/`, `artifacts/`).
- Ensures naming conventions (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes/IDs) and links to relevant documentation.
- Optionally auto-registers new content in index/registry files (e.g., updates `index.ts` or registry JSON).
- Provides example templates for each content type, with comments for required fields.
- Validates that generated files do not overwrite existing content unless explicitly allowed.
- Outputs a summary of actions and next steps for the user.

## Inputs
- Content type (mission, event, threat)
- Name/ID
- Description/objectives/triggers (for missions)
- Parameters (for events/threats)
- Optional: output format (YAML/JSON/TS), overwrite flag

## Outputs
- New code and artifact files in correct locations
- Console/log output of actions taken
- Warnings if files already exist or if required fields are missing

## Acceptance Criteria
- Script can generate at least one of each type (mission, event, threat)
- Files are valid, follow naming conventions, and appear in the correct directories
- New content is discoverable by the game engine (auto-registered if possible)
- No accidental overwrites without user confirmation
- Output includes next steps and links to relevant docs

# Artifact: copilot_content_consistency_checker_2025-06-04.artifact

## Title
Content Consistency Checker for Missions and Artifacts

## Purpose
Ensure that all missions, events, and threats defined in artifacts are implemented in code, and vice versa. Detects missing handlers, outdated objectives, or mismatches.

## Description
- Scans artifact files and code directories for mission/event/threat definitions.
- Compares lists and flags missing or outdated items.
- Outputs a report (plain text and JSON) and can auto-create `.task` files for discrepancies.
- Can be run as a CLI tool or as part of CI.
- Supports filtering by content type or directory.
- Provides actionable suggestions for resolving inconsistencies.

## Inputs
- Artifact files (YAML/JSON)
- Code files (TypeScript)
- Optional: filter by type, output format

## Outputs
- Consistency report (console, file, and/or artifact)
- Optional auto-generated `.task` files for missing/invalid content
- Suggestions for next actions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Detects at least one missing or outdated item
- Generates actionable output for developers
- Can be integrated into CI or run manually

- Outputs a summary list with key metadata (name, type, description, file path)
- Supports output as console table, markdown, or JSON
- Flags missing metadata or malformed files

## Inputs
- None (auto-discovers content)
- Optional: output format

## Outputs
