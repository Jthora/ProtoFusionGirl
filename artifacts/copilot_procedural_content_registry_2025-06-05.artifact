# Procedural Content Registry & Modding API

## Purpose
Manage all procedural generation rules, modded content, and dynamic assets in a versioned, queryable registry. Ensure save/load integrity and replayability across updates and mods.

## Key Features
- Registry of seeds, datakeys, mod hashes, and procedural rules.
- Versioning and migration helpers for procedural content and mods.
- APIs for mods to register new content, events, or rules.
- Integration with save/load and world state systems.

## Data Model
- Versioned content registry (seeds, datakeys, rules, assets).
- Mod metadata and compatibility info.

## Prototype Plan
1. Define registry schema and versioning strategy.
2. Implement mod/content registration and lookup APIs.
3. Add migration helpers for mod/content updates.
4. Integrate with save/load and tile/datakey systems.
5. Test with sample mods and procedural rule changes.

## Conflict & Deprecation Handling
- Define strategies for handling conflicting or deprecated content (e.g., mod removal, rule changes).
- Registry should support marking content as deprecated and provide migration paths.

## Registry Schema & API Surface
- Sketch out schema for content entries (seed, datakey, rule, asset, version, status).
- API: registerContent, lookupContent, deprecateContent, migrateContent, validateMod.

## Security & Validation
- Validate mod submissions for integrity, compatibility, and security.
- Provide sandboxing or review for untrusted mods.
