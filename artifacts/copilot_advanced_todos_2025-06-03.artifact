# Copilot Advanced TODOs (2025-06-03)

## Onboarding & Discoverability
- [ ] Create an **AI Onboarding Artifact**: Summarize artifact types, key scripts, onboarding flow, and “start here” pointers. Include a checklist for new agents.
- [ ] Add a **Project State/Next Steps Artifact**: Summarize current project state, open questions, and next priorities for both AI and humans.
- [ ] Enhance `listScripts.js` to include script descriptions, usage examples, and onboarding relevance.
- [ ] Add a **guided onboarding script** that walks a new agent through the most important artifacts, scripts, and conventions, and verifies understanding.

## Artifact/Code Linkage & Robustness
- [ ] Implement **bi-directional code/artifact mapping**: For each artifact, list all code files that reference it (and vice versa). Optionally, update artifact headers with “referenced by” fields.
- [ ] Add a script to **warn if code references a non-canonical artifact version** (e.g., not the latest or not marked as canonical).
- [ ] Add a script to **auto-update or prompt for artifact/code reference updates** when artifacts are renamed or deleted.

## Artifact System Edge Cases
- [ ] Add a script to **visualize the artifact dependency/importance graph** (foundational vs. advanced artifacts, onboarding order).
- [ ] Add a script to **prompt for feedback/retrospective linkage** when creating those artifacts, and update both sides with cross-links.
- [ ] Add a script to **summarize and clean up unused or deprecated artifacts** (optionally prompt for archival or deletion).

## Memory & Context Expansion
- [ ] Expand `copilot_memory.artifact` with new heuristics, lessons, and context as the project evolves.
- [ ] Add a script to **prompt for context/memory expansion** when new systems or artifacts are added.

## Edge Case Handling
- [ ] Add checks for: artifact deleted/renamed but still referenced in code; multiple artifacts with similar names; feedback artifacts not linked to their source; primer bloat; scripts added but not documented; AI agent starts with no context.
