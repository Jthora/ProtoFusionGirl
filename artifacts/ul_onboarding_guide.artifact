## Visual Flowchart

![UL System Flowchart](images/ul_system_flowchart.png)

- **UL Symbol/Movement Map** → **Formal Grammar (First-Order Logic)** → **Expression Examples (with Model Validation)** → **Animation Library (with Geometric/Logic Annotations)** → **Puzzle Templates (with Formal Logic)** → **API Contract (Formal Predicates, Model Checks)**
- All artifacts are now grounded in the mathematical and logical structure from the UL whitepapers, including all core and extended symbols (curve, angle, spiral, zigzag, leap).

## Quickstart Checklist

1. Review the symbol-movement map and formal grammar (first-order logic signature, axioms, deduction rules) for all symbols: point, line, circle, triangle, square, curve, angle, wave, spiral, zigzag, leap.
2. Study example expressions with formal parsing and model-theoretic validation, including new symbols and edge cases.
3. Use the animation library to preview gestures and their geometric/logic properties for all mapped symbols.
4. Reference puzzle templates for designing new content, ensuring logic/model validity for all symbol types.
5. Integrate with the UL API, which now encodes/decodes/validates using formal predicates for all symbols.
6. Run validation scripts and model checks before committing changes.

## Troubleshooting

- **Problem:** Sequence not recognized
  - **Solution:** Check for well-formedness and validate against the formal grammar/axioms, including new symbol types.
- **Problem:** Animation not playing
  - **Solution:** Ensure the animation is mapped to a valid UL symbol and geometric property (including curve, angle, spiral, zigzag, leap).
- **Problem:** API returns error code
  - **Solution:** Refer to the API contract for error code meanings and model-theoretic edge cases.

## FAQ

- **Q:** How do I add a new symbol or move?
  - **A:** Update the symbol-movement map with geometric/logical properties, add animations, and update the formal grammar/axioms for all new symbols.
- **Q:** What if my sequence is invalid?
  - **A:** Use the troubleshooting section and check for well-formedness and model validity, including edge cases for new symbols.
- **Q:** Can I create custom puzzles?
  - **A:** Yes, use the puzzle templates and ensure your logic is valid in the formal model for all symbol types.

## Glossary

- **UL Symbol:** A geometric or movement-based unit of meaning, with formal logic/geometric definition. Includes point, line, circle, triangle, square, curve, angle, wave, spiral, zigzag, leap.
- **Primitive:** A basic movement or gesture mapped to a UL symbol, with explicit geometric property.
- **Grammar Rule:** Syntax for combining primitives, now defined as first-order logic axioms and deduction rules for all symbols.
- **UL Expression:** A sequence of primitives, parsed as a conjunction of formal predicates.
- **API Contract:** The interface for encoding, decoding, and validating UL expressions as formal logic objects.
